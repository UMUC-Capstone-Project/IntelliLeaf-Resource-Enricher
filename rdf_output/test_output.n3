      rdfs:comment """We have obtained data from a phase I/II clinical trial of patients with end stage cervical cancer and of patients with vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) grade III.  Preclinical animal studies have shown that long peptides of 25-35 amino acids in length upon injection are only processed efficiently for MHC class I by dendritic cells in vivo. Long peptide injection is followed by appropriate cognate interactions between such DC, CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+ CTL precursors.

Three groups of end stage cervical cancer patients (in total N=35) were subcutaneously vaccinated with HPV16 E6 combined with or separated from HPV16 E7 overlapping long peptides in Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant, 4 times at three week intervals. Group 1 received 300 microgram per peptide at a single site, group 2 received 100 microgram per peptide of the E6 peptides in one limb, and 300 microgram per peptide of the E7 peptides in a second limb. Group 3 received separate injections of E6 and E7 peptides, each at a dose of 50 micrograms per peptide. The primary endpoint was to determine safety and toxicity of the HPV16 long peptide vaccine. In addition, the vaccine-induced T-cell response was assessed by IFN gamma-ELISPOT. No toxicity beyond grade II was observed during and after 4 vaccinations. In a few patients transient flu-like symptoms were observed. ELISPOT analysis of the vaccine-induced immune response revealed that co-injection of the E6 and E7 peptides resulted in a strong and broad T-cell response dominated by immunity against E6. Injection of the E6 and E7 peptides at two different sites increased the E7-response but did not affect the magnitude of the E6-induced immune response.

The HPV16 E6 and E7 long-peptide based vaccine is well tolerated and capable of inducing a broad IFN gamma-associated T-cell response, even in end stage cervical cancer patients. 5 out of 20 patients showed complete clearance of all VIN III disease and in 4 of these this was also associated with complete clearance of HPV16 virus. In conclusion, our peptide based vaccine is safe, elicits a strong and broad HPV16 specific T cell response, even under sub-optimal clinical conditions. We have now observed 9 months later, without further vaccination, that another 4 patients have achieved complete remission of all disease, confirmed by microscopy. Sustained benefit was observed in all 9 patients with complete remission of disease. This is also expected, because the 5 complete responders at 3 months after the last vaccination were also shown to be free of HPV16 at the site of the original vaccination. We conclude that this therapeutic vaccine trial caused complete disease regression in 9 out of 20 patients (45%), whereas spontaneous complete regression of VIN3 lesions occurs in less than 1.5% of patients. Another 6 patients had objective partial regressions of lesions 12 months after the last vaccination. At three months after vaccination there was a highly significant positive correlation between the strength of the interferon gamma and proliferative T cell response and the clinical response.  In summary, clinical benefit was observed in 15 out of 20 patients (75%). A paper describing these results has been submitted for publication. Preclinical evidence has shown that these long peptides act so well as a therapeutic vaccine, because only dendritic cells can efficiently process all potential epitopes from the long peptides and because concentrated antigen is offered to the immune system in the absence of antigenic competition. 


Additionally tissue biopsies of the last vaccination site and of the VIN lesion prior to the first vaccination and 3 months after the last vaccination were analysed for the presence of HPV16-specific T cells. The IFN?-ELISPOT analysis and proliferation with its accompanying cytokine production revealed a strong and broad vaccine-induced T cell response. The strength of the immune response (defined as breath and magnitude of the response) was significantly higher in the patients with a complete remission (CR) than in the patients with no changes (NC) in the lesion size. Phenotypical anlaysis revealed a strong induction of CD4+ T-cells specifically against HPV16 E6 and E7, whereas CD8+ T cells were found merely against HPV16 E6 and to a less broad array of epitopes within each patient. This analysis was done after one in vitro restimulation, however, by directly ex vivo flow cytometric analysis hardly any CD8+ T cell response could be detected. 

The T cell cultures obtained from the biopsies taken of the last vaccination site were found to be HPV16 peptides specific in 3/5 tested NR patients and in 4/5 tested CR. However, recognition of the recombinant HPV16 E6 and/or E7 protein was observed in 1/5 cultures from NR patients and 4/5 cultures of the CR patients, suggesting the differences in vaccine-induced T-cell reactivity. Tissue biopsies of the VIN lesion before and after vaccination showed only in one patient a HPV16-specific T-cell response, which was against HPV16 E6 and merely of the type 2 cytokine producing T cells. Notably, no T-cell cultures could be obtained from VIN biopsies taken from the CR patients.

In conclusion, the HPV16 E6 and E7 synthetic long peptides vaccine is highly immunogenic, in that it increases the number and activity of HPV16-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells to a broad array of epitopes in all patients. The expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-specific T-cells, both considered to be important in the anti-tumor response indicates the immunotherapeutic potential of this vaccine. Addition of a strong toll-like receptor ligand might increase the CD8 response in frequency and to a broader set of epitopes.

Conducting a new clinical trial in which the peptide vaccination is combined with the application of Aldara? on the vaccination site in order to induce a strong CD4+ but more importantly a CD8+ T cell response, which can be detected directly ex vivo.

      rdfs:comment """Our lab obtained data on the ability of NK cell IFN-gamma production to predict long term survival in advanced GISTs treated with IM.

Background: Mutant isoforms of the KIT or PDGF receptors expressed by gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are considered the therapeutic targets for imatinib mesylate (IM) (Gleevec®, Novartis), a specific inhibitor of these tyrosine kinase receptors. Predictive factors for the response to IM pertain to the intrinsic features of GIST tumor cells but not to the host. Besides its direct antiproliferative activity on tumor cells, IM can trigger NK cell effectors which contribute to tumor regression in mice. 

Therefore, we addressed whether NK cell functions could be independent prognostic factors predicting long term survival to IM therapy.

Methods: The functional phenotype of NK cells was followed up in 77 GIST patients enrolled in two Phase III trials from 2 institutions testing dosing or duration of IM administration (EORTC 62005 and BFR14 trials). “Immunological responders” were defined as patients whose NK cell IFN-gamma values after 2 months of IM were higher or equal to the baseline value at entry in the trial. The prognostic impact of IFN-gamma on progression-free survival was assessed by a Wald test in a Cox regression analysis using the landmark method and stratified by trial and on the c-kit mutational status. 

Results: 
56 patients were evaluable for the NK cell IFN-gamma responses at baseline and 2 months. Their median follow-up for progression-free survival was 3.7 years. 34/56 patients were “immunological responders” to IM. In the Cox regression analysis stratified by trial, immunological responders possessed a hazard ratio of progression or death equal to 0.29 (95% CI [0.12-0.70], p=0.006) as compared to non-responders. Kaplan-Meier two-year survival estimates were 85% for immunological responders and 50% for non-responders. Moreover, the immunological response added prognostic value to the c-kit mutation. 

Conclusion: 
The NK cell IFN-gamma production after two months of treatment could be considered as an independent predictor of long term survival in advanced GISTs treated with IM.""" ;

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We tracked the plasma levels of 41 immunomodulatory proteins in 56 trauma patients from time of injury up to 1 year later. In addition, a murine model was developed to distinguish between the effects of transfusion and underlying injury and blood loss. RESULTS: Thirty-one of the proteins had a significant change over time after traumatic injury, with a mixed early response that was predominantly anti-inflammatory followed by a later increase in proteins involved in wound healing and homeostasis. Results from the murine model revealed similar cytokine responses to humans. In mice, trauma and hemorrhage caused early perturbations in a number of the pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators measured, and transfusion blunted early elevations in interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and interferon-γ. Transfusion caused or exacerbated changes in monocyte chemotactic protein-1, IL-1α, IL-5, IL-15, and soluble E-selectin. Finally, trauma and hemorrhage alone increased CXCL1 and IL-13. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides a detailed characterization of the major shift in the immunologic environment in response to trauma and transfusion and clarifies which immune mediators are affected by trauma and hemorrhage and which by transfusion." ;

A20 is a zinc finger protein with ubiquitine-modifying activity.  It has been described that A20 negatively regulates signaling induced by the tumor necrosis factor receptor and toll like receptor (TLR) family in a number of cell types, including mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs).  However, the expression and effect of A20 in activated monocyte-derived DCs have not been previously evaluated.  We report that DCs activated with the TLR3 ligand poly(I:C), upregulate A20.  Downregulating A20 demonstrated its role in the functional activation of DCs.  A20 downregulated DCs showed higher activation of the transcription factors nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), which resulted in increased and sustained production of interleukin (IL) -6, IL-10 and IL-12p70.  We additionally silenced the immunosuppressive IL-10 and demonstrated that IL-10 inhibits T cell proliferation.  We further demonstrated that A20 downregulated DCs skew naive CD4+ T cells towards IFN-g producing T helper 1 cells, a process which is dependent on IL-12p70 and which is unaffected by IL-10.  Furthermore, A20 and/or IL-10 downregulated DCs had an enhanced capacity to prime Melan-A/MART-1 specific CD8+ T cells.  Finally, we demonstrated that potent T cell stimulatory DCs are generated by the simultaneous delivery of poly(I:C12U), A20 or A20/IL-10 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and antigen-encoding mRNA, introducing a one step approach to improve DC-based vaccines.  Together these findings demonstrate that A20 negatively regulates NF-kB and AP-1 in DCs and that silencing of A20 results in DCs with enhanced T cell stimulatory capacity.

The generated DC will be clinically tested.""" ;

These patients are being vaccinated with cytokine cocktail matured DCs electroporated with mRNA encoding Tat, Rev and Nef.  The cDNA’s encoding these early expressed HIV antigens have been human codon optimized and modified with lysosomal targeting sequences.  Four vaccines separated by 4 weeks.  Two weeks after the 4th vaccine, an analytical HAART interruption was started. So far, 17 patients have been included in this study.  

Background:
The limitations of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) have necessitated the development of alternative therapeutic strategies. One of the approaches that has gained prominence in recent years is therapeutic vaccination. We decided to assess the capacity of mature dendritic cells, derived from blood monocytes of HIV-1 infected patients, to generate functional T-cell responses. For this purpose, we constructed a chimeric mRNA encoding the proteins Tat, Rev and Nef. The TaReNef encoding information was linked to the HLA class II-targeting sequence of DC-LAMP. Broadly directed HIV-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells exhibiting a poly-functional cytokine secretion pattern were generated by co-culturing with autologous chimeric mRNA electroporated dendritic cells. Thus, administration of ex vivo generated dendritic cells expressing the early proteins Tat, Rev and Nef might offer a promising approach for therapeutic vaccination in HIV-1 infection.

For instance, we set up an assay to measure the proportions of Treg cells in tissues or cells that is based on the demethylation of a region of the FOXP3 promoter, which is observed in human Treg cells but not in the other T cells that can express FOXP3 transiently after activation. Starting from DNA, two quantitative PCR are used, which amplify the methylated and unmethylated FOXP3 promoter sequences. The ratio between the expression levels is, in our hands, a faithful Treg marker. 

We will pursue our genetic analysis of T lymphocytes inside melanoma metastases: analyze their activation status, compare them with T cells infiltrating DTH reactions, explore the reasons for their apparent quiescence.""" ;

For this purpose we used multimers kindly provided by Pierre Coulie (Brussels) together with surface markers (such as CD8, CD4, CD3, CD45RA, CCR7, CD25, CD27, CD137, CD127) in different 8-color panels on the BD FACSCanto II. Additionally we used functional markers such as CD107a and intracellular cytokine staining for the further analysis of individual T-cell populations and T-cell clones.

Monitoring of the ongoing vaccination trial with RNA transfected autologous DC was done with overlapping peptides covering the whole protein sequence of the tumor antigens MageA3, MelanA and Survivin. With this approach we monitored the immune responses of 8 vaccinated patients and of more than 15 other stage IV melanoma patients. Results showed broad preexisting T-cell responses in some patients and de novo immune reactivity in 3 vaccinated patients. The fine specificity of these immune responses needs to be further defined.

The procedure allows a user to compare his/her microarray data to the corpus of public immunology experiments stored in DC-BASE using pathway signatures. The procedure is made up by several steps.

1.Raw data normalization: the user uploads raw data (Affymetrix or Illumina gene expression platforms are supported) and select the species. Upon succesful upload, raw data is normalized using a standard procedure.

2.Comparison selection: The user is then asked to select which samples correspond to the treatment group, and which to the control group. Subsequently, the user has to select which treated-untreated comparisons to make (using single sample). The pipeline takes these information and combines them with the normalized data to create treated-reference paired ratios corresponding to all comparisons the user has selected.

3.Generation of pathway signatures: the pipeline takes the produced ratios and runs a Fisher's Exact Test analysis over a pathway set of 82 immunologically-related pathways, obtaining signed p-values for each of the pathway in the set (positive indicates up-regulation, negative down-regulation). Those p-values are then converted into a “pathway signature” for each comparison: each p-value for a specific pathway under a threshold (0.05) is converted to either 1 (up-regulated), -1 (down-regulated), or 0 if above the threshold.

4.Similarity assessment: a matrix containing all the signatures for all the pathways is compared with the signatures calculated from the DC-BASE experiments using a  method known as clustering with multiscale bootstrap resampling. The result is a clustering image in PDF format (downloadable by the user)  which shows the pathway activation state for all the samples and which indicates very similar samples with red branches in the clustering tree. The user can also download the table used for clustering to use it with other programs.""" ;

      dc:description "Bladder cancer is a common cancer with particularly high recurrence after transurethral resection. In this study, we investigated the prognostic value of the protein expression of cathepsin E, maspin, polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), and survivin in patients with stage Ta and T1 urothelial carcinomas. Transcripts from the four genes encoding these proteins were previously included in gene expression signatures for outcome prediction for Ta/T1 bladder cancer. We used three different tissue microarrays with 693 non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinomas from Danish, Swedish, and Spanish patient cohorts with long-term follow-up. Protein expression was measured by immunohistochemistry, and antibody specificity was validated by Western blotting. In the Danish patient cohort, we found the expression of cathepsin E, maspin, Plk1, and survivin to be significantly associated with progression to stage T2 to T4 bladder cancer (for each marker: log-rank test; P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified cathepsin E (P < 0.001), Plk1 (P = 0.021), maspin (P = 0.001), and survivin (P = 0.001) as independent prognostic markers. Furthermore, maspin, survivin, and cathepsin E expression significantly subgrouped patients already stratified by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer risk scores. Finally, we successfully validated the results in tumors from 410 patients from both Sweden and Spain. We conclude that all four protein markers may have prognostic value in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer for guiding optimal treatment of patients. Additional prospective studies are needed for further validation of the clinical relevance of this marker panel." ;

The most common anticipated usage is to identify an RDF schema, given a name for one of the properties or classes defined by that schema. Although XML namespace declarations will typically provide the URI where RDF vocabulary resources are defined, there are cases where additional information is required. 

For example, constructs such as 
<rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/Creator\"/>
do not indicate the URI of the schema that includes the vocabulary item Creator (i.e., http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/).

      rdfs:comment """We have been developing the DC-ATLAS DC-pathway database. For this, we have set about identifying key signalling pathways that were likely to be of most relevance to dendritic cell functions. We have designed a DC-ATLAS data model to effectively describe pathways, their genes, and their interaction. We produced a controlled vocabulary that contains at least 400 ontological terms, prepared on the basis of the proposals and discussions among the researchers involved in DC-ATLAS project. We defined the pathway representation where each pathway was described using three different means: a PDF format, a gene list, and a graphical representation. The pathways data model and controlled vocabulary was developed in collaboration with Sorin Draghici and the Leaf Bioscience group lead by A. Splendiani.

DC ATLAS integrates the signalling modules of the DC, curating specifically 
(i) the pathways leading from immature dendritic cells to mature dendritic cells, and 
(ii) the pathways depending on interaction between different cell types (e.g. DC and T cells interaction, leading to Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg polarisation, and apoptosis). 

Given the complexity of the problem we have built a unique group of curators with the primary purpose of describing separately: 
(1) the section of the pathway sensing the stimulus and transmitting the stimulus to the general signal transduction pathway; 
(2) the principal signal transduction modules used by the DC; and 
(3) the outcomes (e.g. cytokine production, apoptosis, migration, differentiation). 

From over 200 pathways, a list of some 30-40 was prioritised for immediate attention. These were then assigned to individual curators, drawn from across the Network and including some of its Third Parties. Among the curated pathways are TCR/ slam receptor; PPAR P PPAR Gamma; TCR Ag proc/pres; TLR4; TLR7+8; TLR 2 + 1; TLR6+2; MHC1 MHC2 pathways- antigen presentation; TLR3; DC-Sign; TLR 5+; TCR – motility; Dectin-1.

The curation process revealed substantial inaccuracies and errors in publicly-available databases. For the first time, this initiative clarified differences between homologous pathways operating in dendritic cells from human versus mouse (and other species), and in dendritic cells from different sources (e.g. human monocytes-derived versus mouse bone marrow-derived DC, and different primary DC subsets). Draft manuscripts, describing this initiative and its first results were prepared and will be submitted as DC-THERA joint publications.

A meeting will be organized for defining policies on data sharing within the DC-THERA community and beyond. 

In order to populate DC-BASE with data obtained from the literature, we used the GEO Import Perl program to download the required experiments from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and to convert them into a spreadsheet based format called MAGE-TAB. MAGE-TAB data has then been imported into DC-BASE.

We have collaborated with the team lead by Andrea Splendiani for the definition of shared terminologies for the annotation of the microarray datasets. These terminologies are at the basis of semantic interoperability with other resources, and the DC-THERA Directory in particular. More specifically, a query to to the Directory will propagate to the DC-ATLAS microarray repository. The DC-THERA Directory will then present a summary of results found.

      dc:description "Choroidal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignant tumour in adults. The aim of the study was to examine epidemiological characteristics of choroidal melanoma in Split-Dalmatia County from 1990 to 2009. In this retrospective study, data on 46 patients from medical documentation of the University Department of Ophthalmology, Split University Hospital Center, were analyzed. According to 2001 census, the Split-Dalmatia County population was 467,676 inhabitants. The incidence of choroidal melanoma was 0.49 per 100,000 inhabitants, which is somewhere in the middle of the incidence between south and north Europe. Choroidal melanoma most commonly appeared in the 7th decade of life. The average dimensions of choroidal melanoma (basis x height) were 13.4 x 8.0 mm. Histopathologic findings according to Callender classification showed the following types of melanoma: epithelioid cell type 8%, spindle cell type 40%, and mixed type 52%. The most common forms of therapy were enucleation 47.8% and brachytherapy 28.3%, which means that patients presented relatively late when choroidal melanoma advanced in size. The Split-Dalmatia County has 1/10 of the Croatian population, so it could be supposed that approximately 25 new cases of malignant melanoma of the choroid are discovered annually in Croatia. For early detection of the disease, regular and complete checkups are necessary, especially in presbyopic population. Study results enabled better evaluation of the disease and better planning of ophthalmologic service in the treatment of this serious eye disease." ;

An important conclusion that can be made from these pilot-observations is that the potential therapeutic effect of our DC-based MAA-vaccination approach does not occur instantly but is delayed by 8-12w following the first vaccination (i.e.12-16w after the isolation of PBMC by leukapheresis given the 4w that are necessary for preparation of the DC-vaccine and the extensive quality control).

      dc:description "Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin and parthenolide have been shown to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. However, the combined effect of geldanamycin and parthenolide on epithelial ovarian cancer cells has not been studied. In the respect of cell death process, we investigated the promoting effect of parthenolide on geldanamycin-induced apoptosis in the human epithelial ovarian carcinoma cell lines OVCAR-3 and SK-OV-3. Geldanamycin induced a decrease in Bid, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and survivin protein levels; an increase in Bax and tumour suppressor p53 levels; loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential; cytochrome c release; activation of caspases (-8, -9 and -3); cleavage of PARP-1; and increase in the reactive oxygen species formation. Parthenolide enhanced geldanamycin-induced changes in the apoptosis-related protein levels, reactive oxygen species formation, nuclear damage and cell death. The combined effect was inhibited by the addition of oxidant scavengers. The results suggest that parthenolide may potentiate the apoptotic effect of geldanamycin on ovarian carcinoma cell lines by the activation of the caspase-8- and Bid-dependent pathway and the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. The apoptosis promoting effect seems to be mediated by the stimulatory effect on the formation of reactive oxygen species." ;

Our aim was to examine the beneficial effects of ulinastatin on pulmonary damage associated with scald injury. Lewis rats were subjected to 30% total body surface area (TBSA) scald injury and were randomly divided into a burn control (S group) and an ulinastatin-treated group (U group). Lung malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were determined, and the lungs were examined histologically with immunohistochemistry (IHC) as well for the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I chain-related antigen A (MICA) and Bcl-2 at 24, 48 and 72h after the injury. The expression of spleen human leucocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) was detected by immunohistochemistry analysis. Selectins and adhesion molecules in lungs and serum were also detected. The lung injury degree was represented as wet/dry (W/D) values and alveolar thickness. Ulinastatin decreased MDA levels and ameliorated the down-regulation of SOD activity. MICA was up-regulated after the scald, and this up-regulation was greatly diminished by ulinastatin. Bcl-2 was up-regulated after the scald, especially in the U group. The spleen HLA-DR expression demonstrated the immunoregulatory effects of ulinastatin, which effectively protected the pulmonary tissues from scald-induced injury. Our results demonstrated that pulmonary damage was associated with autoimmunity and oxidant attack after severe scald. Ulinastatin exhibits significant protective effects on these effects." ;

      rdfs:comment """At the end of 2004 BruCells has initiated two identical clinical studies entitled: “A Phase IB/II Study of Immunotherapy with Autologous Dendritic Cells Pulsed with Multiple HLA-A2 and MAGE-3.DP4 Peptides in Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma Patients”. Patients received sequential immunizations with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with 8 HLA-restricted HLA-A2 peptides and a MAGE-3.DP4 peptide. They were randomized to receive immunizations either with I3 DC (DC generated with interferon-beta and interleukin-3) or with G4 DC (DC generated with GM-CSF and IL-4). At the end of 2005 the study was prematurely terminated due to low recruitment, data on patient responses is available.

2 patients received vaccines up to cycle 3. One of them is an I3 patient (E501) who has received 9 vaccines with peptides only. The other one is a G4 patient (E507) who has received 6 vaccines with peptide only. Both patients received a sequence of six immunizations every two weeks, consisting of autologous dendritic cells loaded with the 8 HLA-A2 restricted peptides and MAGE.3-DP4 in Cycle 1. In Cycle 2, they received a sequence of three immunizations every six weeks, consisting of autologous dendritic cells loaded with the 8 HLA-A2 restricted peptides and MAGE.3-DP4. Initially, in Cycle 3, immunizations have been continued with peptide-only injections of all 9 peptides except Tyrosinase at 12 weeks intervals. For the continuation of the vaccinations the clinicians have decided to inject the patients at 6 months intervals. Both patients who clinically showed Partial Response at the end of cycle 1 are currently doing well under this treatment, but at the beginning of 2008 the vaccination program has been ended.
Both patients had clinically shown Partial Response at the end of cycle 1 and were in complete remission in the course of cycle 3.

For the analysis of the immune responses, specific CTL directed against the 8 antigens was assessed by using restimulation in vitro, followed by staining with the corresponding tetramer and cloning of the tetramer-positive lymphocytes. The result of these tests were considered positive if the post-immunization frequency of the different anti-TAA CTLp among the CD8+ T cells was 10-fold higher than the one encountered before vaccination.
For both patients the tests were performed on frozen peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) obtained from leukapheresis or buffy-coat collections performed before and after the 6 vaccinations in Cycle 1 and after the 3 vaccinations of Cycle 2.

The fresh PBL samples were collected from UTCM (Hôpital Erasme, ULB) and were transferred to Ludwig Institute where the freezing of the samples and analyses were performed.

Frequencies of precursors of CD8 T cells stained by a tetramer containing the specific peptide had shown for patient E501 post-vaccination frequencies of the T cells of anti-NY-ESO-1.A2 and anti-Tyrosinase.A2 that were >=10-fold higher than that of pre-vaccinations, indicating a specific CTL response to these vaccinations.

An analysis performed on PBL collected after the 3 vaccinations of cycle 2 clearly shows that the frequencies for both anti-NY-ESO-1.A2 and anti-Tyrosinase.A2 T cells are still elevated.

For E507 no immunological response to the vaccinations had been observed after cycle 1 and a new analysis on PBL collected after cycle 2 did not show any change.""" ;

The proliferation consisted of lobules of epithelioid and spindled cells with S100, Melan-A and HMB-45 positivity but without obvious melanin pigmentation. The nuclei were moderately pleomorphic in some areas, and in a few areas the mitotic index was elevated. Schwannian differentiation was inferred from the presence of areas with nuclear palisading resembling Verocay bodies, from plexiform architecture and from the presence of a thin rim of EMA positivity around the tumor. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization showed genomic losses that overlap with those seen in sporadic schwanomma. The differential diagnosis included melanoma, melanotic schwannoma and cutaneous melanocytoneuroma, and we compare and contrast our case with these entities.

Jointly, P2 and P6 identified a large number of stored samples of DC from melanoma patients (who had been treated in clinical trials of DC-based therapy at the two respective centres) that would be suitable for subsequent analysis. However, it further became clear that there were differences in the techniques that had been used to freeze the samples at different period. This necessitated a pilot experiment to compare and assess the suitability (e.g. RNA stability) of different samples frozen in different ways. First results are available. These revealed that all stored samples could be analysed in detail, and it was further decided to process the samples such that analysis of micro-RNA expression could be undertaken at a later stage. Patient samples have been shipped from the two centres to the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics and the main ‘reference experiment’ commenced at the beginning of 2009.""" ;

Accumulation of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) with the ability to suppress T cells has been observed in serveral types of cancer, including melanoma. Using blood from melanoma patients we are investigating phenotypic markers that can be used to further characterize MDSC, focusing on molecules that are related to their suppressive function. As it is believed that recruitment from the bone marrow by tumor derived factors leads to increased presence of immature myeloid cells in the blood, we are testing substances that could induce maturation and thereby turn immature suppressor cells into mature cells capable of efficient antigen presentation.
So far we have collected blood from >10 melanoma patients and compared the MDSC phenotype and function with healthy donor derived cells. 

We will collect further material to perform detailed studies of phenotype and function of MDSC in melanoma patients. Using some model substances we are testing a group of drugs for its ability to induce MDSC maturation. We are also interested in studying the effect of MDSC on other immune cells.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """We are preparing a protocol for a phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced (stage III or IV) melanoma. Patients will receive a DC vaccination regimen followed by 3 adoptive transfers of autologous in vitro expanded T cells. This novel approach combines in vivo priming by the DC vaccine with passive immunotherapy by lymphocyte infusion. 

Patients will undergo surgical removal of a metastatic lesion and leukapheresis at the beginning of the trial to provide sources for tumor antigens as well as monocytes and T cells, which will be isolated from the leukapheresis product by elutriation. Patients will undergo lymphodepletion prior to vaccination and prior to adoptive transfer of autologous T cells. The DC vaccine will consist of monocyte derived DC loaded with tumor lysate generated from the excised lesion. The T cell transfer will consist of T cells expanded by co-culture with tumor lysate loaded DC. 

The primary objective of this trial is to determine toxicity and feasibility of treatment of patients with advanced melanoma with DC vaccine and adoptive transfer. The secondary objective is to generate large numbers of tumor reactive T cells, characterize these T cells and evaluate immunological and clinical responses in treated patients.

Recently we have optimized our T cell expansion protocol by testing different cytokines and evaluating whether T cell expansion can be improved by using antigen loaded DC as stimulators at all times. We find that mixed PBMCs have superior stimulatory capacity and that IL-2 had the best cost-benefit ratio and will therefore not modify the original protocol. The study protocol has been reviewed by the local ethical committee and is now ready to be submitted to Läkemedelsverket, the Swedish regulatory authority for clinical trials.

Upon approval by swedish authorities we plan to include, treat and evaluate 10 patients during a period of one to two years. """ ;

New prognostic markers for malignant melanoma are urgently needed. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX-2) have been described to correlate with progression of melanoma. Moreover, activating mutations in BRAF/NRAS oncogenes are often detected in melanoma. We have examined the BRAF/NRAS mutation status and expression of COX-2 and iNOS to compare their prognostic value for overall survival in stage III malignant melanoma.   

Real time and immunohistochemistry analysis showed that both iNOS and COX-2 alone significantly predicted OS. The BRAF/NRAS mutation status did not significantly differ between patient groups, although iNOS significantly correlated with BRAF mutation frequency. Furthermore, iNOS and COX-2 were significantly linked to a number of metastatic lymph nodes. However, iNOS maintained its statistical significance together with a number of lymph nodes in the multivariate analysis and predicted OS, whereas COX-2 did.

We will now move on to study iNOS and COX-2 expression in fresh melanoma tumors. Here we aim to determine the exact phenotype of the iNOS and COX-2 expressing cells. We are especially interested to study expression of these enzymes by tumor infiltrating myeloid cells. Expression of iNOS is a known suppressive mechanism employed by myeloid derived suppressor cells. We will study the presence and function of such suppressive myeloid cells within the tumor.""" ;

      dc:description "Sera of patients with cancer contain membraneous microvesicles (MV) able to induce apoptosis of activated T cells by activating the Fas/Fas ligand pathway. However, the cellular origin of MV found in cancer patients' sera varies as do their molecular and cellular profiles. To distinguish tumor-derived MV in cancer patients' sera, we used MAGE 3/6(+) present in tumors and MV. Molecular profiles of MAGE 3/6(+) MV were compared in Western blots or by flow cytometry with those of MV secreted by dendritic cells or activated T cells. These profiles were found to be distinct for each cell type. Only tumor-derived MV were MAGE 3/6(+) and were variably enriched in 42-kDa Fas ligand and MHC class I but not class II molecules. Effects of MV on signaling via the TCR and IL-2R and proliferation or apoptosis of activated primary T cells and T cell subsets were also assessed. Functions of activated CD8(+) and CD4(+) T lymphocytes were differentially modulated by tumor-derived MV. These MV inhibited signaling and proliferation of activated CD8(+) but not CD4(+) T cells and induced apoptosis of CD8(+) T cells, including tumor-reactive, tetramer(+)CD8(+) T cells as detected by flow cytometry for caspase activation and annexin V binding or by DNA fragmentation. Tumor-derived but not dendritic cell-derived MV induced the in vitro expansion of CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) T regulatory cells and enhanced their suppressor activity. The data suggest that tumor-derived MV induce immune suppression by promoting T regulatory cell expansion and the demise of antitumor CD8(+) effector T cells, thus contributing to tumor escape." ;

Toll receptor 9 (TLR9) is an important pattern recognition receptor. It is stimulated by foreign DNA or CpG motivs. 

We found that TLR9 -/- mice were very susceptible to infection with the mouse pox virus Ectromelia. In contrast to DC from C57Bl/6 mice, DC from TLR9 -/- produced little if any interferon alpha. However, MVA-BN induced IFNalpha in presence or absence of TLR9 -/-. Moreover, coinfection with MVA-BN and Ectromilia protected TLR9 -/- mice against death. Surprisingly, coinfection with MVA-BN and Ectromilia also protected IFNalpha receptor -/- mice. The data show that MVA-BN can induce potent innate immune responses able to control viral replication to allow the specific immune response to eliminate Ectromelia in immune deficient mice.

We furthermore defined that protection by using the attenuated Vaccinia virus MVA to protect mice against poxvirus infection, if used before or at the onset of infection, partially depends on the induction of the antiviral cytokines IFN- type I, but fully depends on the presence of adaptive immune responses. Importantly we were able to demonstrate that post-exposure application for up to three days of MVA rescued mousepox virus infected mice from death. This is the first demonstration of the effectiveness of post-exposure vaccination against pathogenic poxviruses.

We will explore the innate and adaptive immune elements involved in the protection.""" ;

      dc:description "Here, we review a novel vaccine modality, characterized by the administration of long (23 to 45 amino acids) synthetic peptides in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (mineral oil based, Montanide ISA-51), delivered subcutaneously. Such vaccines were first demonstrated to be much more potent in preclinical T-cell response induction and tumor therapy experiments than were short major histocompatibility complex class I-binding peptides. Nevertheless, a recent study has shown the clinical efficacy of an anchor-modified short gp100 peptide in melanoma patients. We now review the evidence and mode of action of a long peptide vaccine consisting of 13 overlapping peptides, together covering the entire length of the 2 oncogenic proteins E6 and E7 of high-risk human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV16), causing complete regression of all lesions and eradicating virus in 9 of 20 women with high-grade vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. The nature and strength of the vaccine-induced T-cell response correlated significantly with the clinical response. This vaccine promises to be of use not only in patients with premalignant lesions caused by high-risk HPV16 but also in malignant tumors caused by this virus, including HPV16-positive cervical cancer, vulvar cancer, anal cancer, and head and neck cancer." ;

We found that MHC class I presentation is relatively short-lived in contrast to MHC class II. However, CD8 cross-priming capacity of OVA-loaded DC was functionally retained for many days, while peptide-pulsed DC had lost their priming capacity after 24 hours. Strikingly, OVA protein antigen was conserved intracellularly in DC for many days. Antigen-derived peptide presentation was efficiently restored after peptide elution from MHC class I at the cell surface, providing a strong association between intracellular antigen depot and the prolonged cross-priming potency of DC. Characterization of the storage compartments shows that these resemble lysosome-like structures, distinct from MHC class II loading compartments. We speculate that DC have adapted an endogenous compartment facilitating prolonged MHC class I presentation from exogenous antigen for effective CD8 T cell cross-priming. 

We have further analyzed the immunological consequences of the antigen depot. T cells that were induced by dendritic cells several days after a short antigen pulse had full proliferative capacity and could kill tumors in vivo. Furthermore, we studies the mechanism of cross-presentation of antigen from the antigen depot. By using inhibitors for the proteasome, we observed that the proteasome is crucial in the presentation of the antigen in MHC class I. 

By using TAP deficient cells, we found that TAP is also necessary for this process. We further characterized the antigen depot by confocal microscopy and found that the antigen co-localized with the lysosomal marker LAMP1, but not with the endosomal marker EEA1, TAP, MHC class I or MHC class II. We conclude that the antigen depot is a storage compartment and not a loading compartment. We have started to examine depot formation by targeting antigen to other receptors. For example, we have found that presentation of TLR ligand- long peptide conjugates was also long-lived, while presentation of OVA, targeted via the mannose receptor, was not long-lived.

We will address the requirement of antigen depot formation in dendritic cells for effective tumor elimination, by pulse-loading experiments of short and long peptides, whole protein immune complexes and TLRL-conjugated peptides. Our goal is to better understand the molecular requirements for antigen depot formation in dendritic cells. To accomplish this, we will further characterize the antigen storage compartment by proteomics. In addition, we want to address the mechanism of processing and presentation in MHC class I and MHC class II from the antigen depot in more detail. Furthermore, we plan to address the question why antigen is not degraded as would be expected in compartments with lysosomal characteristics.""" ;

We have efficiently transfected DC with RNA encoding a functional protein (E/L-selectin), which allows entry of DC into LN from HEV. These DC rolled in vitro on sialyl-LewisX-coated slides, and in vivo, mouse E/L-selectin-transfected DC homed to LN after i.v. application. Monocyte-derived and cocktail-matured DC electroporated with a combination of RNAs encoding tumor antigens (MelanA, Mage3, Survivin) and E/L-selectin are currently used in a clinical trial. To increase RNA stability and to obtain a longer-lasting expression of E/L-selectin on DC, thereby providing a higher chance that DC can migraten efficiently to LN, the RNA was modified by introducing different RNA caps, introducing different 3’ UTRs, and by elongation of the poly A tail. Furthermore, mouse experiments have been started in collaboration with P02 to perform quantification of E/L-selectin-transfected DC that migrated into LN by labelling these cells with Indium or SPIO beads.  

Immunomonitoring of this trial was based on ELISPOT assays with overlapping peptides covering the whole protein sequence of the tumor antigens MageA3, MelanA and Survivin. Most patients already demonstrated broad responses to numerous peptides prior vaccination. Significantly enhanced responses to several peptides and occurrence of new responses was seen in 6 patients, 5 of which were vaccinated with E/L-S+ DC. These data provide evidence for a superior immunopotency of  E/L-selectin expressing DC. The distribution of i.v. given DC is currently being analyzed using Indium labelling.""" ;

Additional in vitro maturation of DC by CD40L (leucine zipper, Immunex) did not result in better immunity compard to standard cytokine cocktail matured DC.

The trial was closed in 2007. Ongoing monitoring has confirmed a clinical correlation of induced immunes responses. In stage IV patients very rapidly progressing patients showed in general weak immune responses after the first vaccinations. The strength and breadth of induced immune responses was, however, identical in patients living up to 24 months or significantly beyond 24 months. Interestingly, we could distinguish between these two groups by transcriptome analysis of pre-vaccination metastases in that long survivors had a preexisting “friendly” non-suppressive micromilieu.

Ex vivo lentivirally transduced dendritic cells (DC) have been described to induce CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses against various tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) in vitro and in vivo. 

We report here that direct administration of ovalbumin (OVA) encoding lentiviral vectors caused in vivo transduction of cells that were found in draining lymph nodes (LNs) and induced potent anti-OVA cytotoxic T cells similar to those elicited by ex vivo transduced DC. The cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response following direct injection of lentiviral vectors was highly effective in eliminating target cells in vivo up to 30 days after immunization and was efficiently recalled after a boost immunization. Injection of lentiviral vectors furthermore activated OVA-specific CD4+ T cells and this CD4 help was shown to be necessary for an adequate primary and memory CTL response. When tested in therapeutic tumor experiments with OVA+ melanoma cells, direct administration of lentiviral vectors slowed down tumor growth to a comparable extent with the highest dose of ex vivo transduced DC. Taken together, these data indicate that direct in vivo administration of lentiviral vectors encoding TAAs has strong potential for anticancer vaccination.""" ;

      dc:description "Although hyper-activated mTOR is well recognized as being pivotal to prostate cancer growth and progression, the underlying mechanisms by which it promotes such responses remain incompletely understood. Here we show that rapamycin activates Smads 1 and 5 in human prostate cancer cells and tissues through blocking mTORC1 kinase. ShRNA-based gene silencing and gene overexpression approaches reveal that Smads 1 and 5 mediate while Smad8 represses rapamycin-induced cell death and expression of the BMP transcriptional target Id1 in human prostate cancer cell lines. Moreover, such phospho-Smad1/5-mediated rapamycin responses were blocked by LDN-193189 (a BMPRI kinase inhibitor) or Noggin (a BMP antagonist) in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Likewise, the mTOR kinase inhibitors Ku-0063794 and WYE-354 each enhanced phosphorylation of Smad1/5. Intriguingly, silencing Raptor alone enhanced while silencing Rictor repressed the phosphorylation of Smad1/5, indicating that mTORC1 represses while mTORC2 activates BMP signaling. Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased levels of phospho-Smad1/5 concomitant with suppression of phospho-S6 and Survivin levels in PC3 human prostate cancer xenografts in athymic mice administered rapamycin (i.p., 5 mg/kg/day, 2 to 6 days). Moreover, we show that compared to prostate tumor tissue from untreated patients, levels of phospho-Smad1/5 were significantly elevated in the prostate tumor tissue of high-risk prostate cancer patients who received 8 weeks of the rapalog everolimus as part of a neoadjuvant clinical trial prior to undergoing local definitive therapy by radical prostatectomy. Taken together, our data implicate Smads 1, 5 and 8 as potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for mTOR inhibition therapy of prostate cancer." ;

We further characterized the antigen depot by confocal microscopy and found that the antigen co-localized with the lysosomal marker LAMP1, but not with the endosomal marker EEA1, TAP, MHC class I or MHC class II. We conclude that the antigen depot is a storage compartment and not a loading compartment. We have started to examine depot formation by targeting antigen to other receptors. For example, we have found that presentation of TLR ligand- long peptide conjugates was also long-lived, while presentation of OVA, targeted via the mannose receptor, was not long-lived.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """Our lab has obtained data on the mechanism of how IL-10 regulates the immune response to MTb infection in mice. 

Control and clearance of intracellular pathogens such as MTb is dependent on the production of TNF and the induction of the T-helper 1 (Th1) cytokine IFN-gamma by IL-12.  Conversely, IL-10 is a suppressive cytokine essential for dampening the immune response to a number of intracellular pathogens to limit host immune pathology.  IL-10 has been shown to exert its suppressive effect by directly acting on the antigen presenting cell (APC), therefore functioning to down-regulate macrophage antimicrobial activity or the induction of Th1 responses by dendritic cells (DC).  However, during infection with pathogens such as T. gondii, IL-10 hinders pathogen clearance but is critical for blocking fatal immune pathology.  In patients with chronic tuberculosis (TB), T cells are present that produce both IL-10 and IFN-gamma and stimulation of MTb-antigen specific T cells ex-vivo in the presence of anti-IL-10 antibodies results in their increased proliferation and IFN- production.  Although this suggests a role for IL-10 in the regulation of the response to MTb, this has not been demonstrated and it is possible that a major role at this stage is to limit immune pathology in chronic disease.  To date in murine models of MTb, a role for IL-10 is controversal. 

We have identified that IL-10 plays an early and transient role in the control of the immune response to MTb and now show that this involves enhanced migration of IFNgamma producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells into the lung rather than enhanced mycobacterial killing. The effects are accompanied by enhanced G-CSF, GM-CSF, TNF, IL-6 and IL-17 levels although the enhanced clearance of bacilli in IL-10 deficient mice we now show is independent of IL-17.

The work describing the mechanism of how IL-10 regulates the immune response to MTb infection is now being completed for publication (a manuscript will be submitted for publication in the next few months; Redford, O’Garra et al., 2009). Work on determining the ability of IL-10 depletion to enhance vaccination against MTb infection is being initiated now to continue this programme, but the majority of this work is the scope of the future outside the remits of DC-THERA.""" ;

      dc:description "OBJECTIVE: 15(S)-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [15(S)-HETE] and 15(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid [15(S)-HPETE] are the products of arachidonic acid formed in the 15-lipoxygenase pathway. They have opposing effects on the inflammatory process. The present study was designed to examine the role of these metabolites on angiogenesis, which is critically associated with inflammatory conditions. METHODS: Chick chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM), rat aortic rings and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in culture were used to study the effect of 15(S)-HETE and 15(S)-HPETE on angiogenesis. Biochemical markers of angiogenesis were analysed by ELISA. RESULTS: 15(S)-HETE increased vessel density in chick CAM, induced sprouting in rat aortic rings and increased endothelial cell-cell contact and formation of tubular network-like structures in HUVECs. Furthermore, it up-regulated the expression of CD31, E-selectin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in HUVECs, indicating its pro-angiogenic effect. 15(S)-HPETE, on the other hand, decreased vessel density in chick CAM, down-regulated the expression of E-selectin (<35 %), VEGF (<90 %) and CD31 (<50 %) and did not produce sprouting in aortic rings, suggesting an anti-angiogenic property. 15(S)-HETE-mediated up-regulation of CD 31 and VEGF was reversed by treatment with 15(S)-HPETE. CONCLUSION: These results indicate the divergent effects of hydroxy and hydroperoxy products of 15-LOX on angiogenesis, highlighting the role of these products in the co-dependence of inflammation and angiogenesis." ;

The authors describe an amelanotic melanoma of the conjunctiva in an 82-year-old female patient. Cytological, histopathological and immunohistochemical studies revealed an invasive amelanotic melanoma exhibiting S-100 and MART-1 positivity. The patient undervent surgical and chemotherapy treatment and three years after the initial treatment is in the terminal stage of metastatic disease. Absence of pigmentation delayed early clinical detection and treatment. Awareness of this nonpigmented melanoma is crucial for early recognition and appropriate management." ;

Everything is carried out under GMP conditions according to SOPs.

In brief, patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma will undergo surgical resection of a melanotic lesion and leukapheresis will be performed on the following day. DCs will be generated from monocytes after elutriation of the leukapheresis product. On day 5 of culture immature DC will be pulsed with irradiated tumor cells (apoptotic bodies) prepared from the removed lesion and matured for 48 hours in presence of TNF-alpha.  Monocyte and DC viability as well as functionality will be continuously monitored. Such prepared DC will be used as DC vaccine, but also to expand T cells (isolated during the elutriation) for subsequent adoptive transfer. Before injection all cell products will be thoroughly tested to exclude contamination and presence of viable tumor cells. A portion of pulsed and unpulsed mature dendritic cells will be frozen and used to monitor immunological responses elicited by the DC vaccine and transferred T cells during the clinical trial. Treatment induced T cell responses will be evaluated by flow cytometry based methods (T cell phenotype, proliferation, perforin degranulation) and cytokine detection (Elispot, Elisa). The patients will be monitored for safety and toxicity of the treatment and for clinical response to immunotherapy.""" ;

      dc:description "BACKGROUND: A recent randomized placebo-controlled trial of the effect of atorvastatin treatment on the progression of newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes suggested a slower decline of residual beta cell function with statin treatment. Aim of this secondary analysis was to identify patient subgroups which differ in the decline of beta cell function during treatment with atorvastatin. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The randomized placebo-controlled Diabetes and Atorvastatin (DIATOR) Trial included 89 patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and detectable islet autoantibodies (mean age 30 years, 40% females), in 12 centers in Germany. Patients received placebo or 80 mg/d atorvastatin for 18 months. As primary outcome stimulated serum C-peptide levels were determined 90 min after a standardized liquid mixed meal. For this secondary analysis patients were stratified by single baseline characteristics which were considered to possibly be modified by atorvastatin treatment. Subgroups defined by age, sex or by baseline metabolic parameters like body mass index (BMI), total serum cholesterol or fasting C-peptide did not differ in C-peptide outcome after atorvastatin treatment. However, the subgroup defined by high (above median) baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations exhibited higher stimulated C-peptide secretion after statin treatment (p = 0.044). Individual baseline CRP levels correlated with C-peptide outcome in the statin group (r(2) = 0.3079, p<0.004). The subgroup with baseline CRP concentrations above median differed from the corresponding subgroup with lower CRP levels by higher median values of BMI, IL-6, IL-1RA, sICAM-1 and E-selectin. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Atorvastatin treatment may be effective in slowing the decline of beta cell function in a patient subgroup defined by above median levels of CRP and other inflammation associated immune mediators.

It is usually assumed that effector gene expression in CD8 T cells may be similar in all immune responses, CD8 T cells in vivo differentiating into cytotoxic T cells that also produce g-inf. In contrast we published in 2007 that CD8 follow several differentiation waves and that effector gene expression is heterogeneous, different effector genes having different kinetics of expression-down regulation and associating randomly, suggesting that different immune responses could induce diverse differentiation patterns. 

In the present year: 
1° We studied the first differentiation wave, that occurs immediately after antigen stimulation, when cells able to induce inflammation are produced. We found a major expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines that is restricted to this period. We also developed an in vivo test where these effectors are transplanted in a matrigel, to study their capacity to attract other cell types. 

2° We initiated a vast comparison between CD8 T cells responding to very different stimuli. Our preliminary results show that CD8 T cells responding either to virus or Listeria have very different properties, indicating that the inflammatory context defines CD8 T cells with different properties.

CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were efficiently transfected with immunoreceptors specific for ErbB2 and CEA. The immunoreceptor expression was transient with half-maximal expression at day 2 and no detectable immunoreceptor expression at day 9 after electroporation. Immunoreceptor-transfected T cells were specifically activated upon coincubation with ErbB2(+) and CEA(+) tumor cells, respectively, resulting in secretion of interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha). Furthermore, immunoreceptor-transfected CD8(+) T cells specifically lysed ErbB2(+) and CEA(+) tumor cells, respectively. The RNA-transfected T cells retained their cytotoxic function after 2 days of activation and exhibited cytolytic activities like retrovirally transduced T cells. Opposed to  standard procedures using retroviral gene transduction to constitutively express immunoreceptors in T cells, transient immunoreceptor expression by RNA transfection should minimize the risk of persistence of potential autoaggression.""" ;

In this Phase I trial using peptide-pulsed Dex, the observation of clinical regressions in the absence of T cell responses prompted the search for alternate effector mechanisms. Mouse studies unraveled the bioactivity of Dex onto NK cells, Dex promoting a IL-15Ra-dependent NK cell proliferation and a NKG2D-dependent activation resulting in an anti-metastatic effect. In humans, Dex bear functional IL-15R? which allow proliferation and IFNg secretion by NK cells. In contrast to immature DC, human Dex harbor NKG2D ligands on their surface leading to a direct engagement of NKG2D and NK cell activation ex vivo. In our phase I clinical trial, we highlight the capacity of Dex based-vaccines to restore the number and NKG2D-dependent function of NK cells in 7/14 patients. In conclusion, these data provide a mechanistic explanation on how Dex may stimulate non MHC restricted-anti-tumor effectors. Therefore, NK cell activation represents a new bioactivity for Dex leading to tumor recognition and regression in vivo.""" ;

DC produced conspicuous amounts of PTX3 when stimulated with LPS and this production is further increased in the presence of IL-10. However, PTX3 production was not increased in other alternative conditions of activation, such as in the presence of dexamethasone or calcitriol. PTX3 has properties similar to antibodies. Its production is induced by pathogen recognition, it recognizes microbial moieties, activates complement and facilitates recognition by phagocytes. Thus, this long pentraxin behaves as a bona fide ante-antibody." ;

      dc:description "Hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma account for 95% of primary liver cancer. For each of these malignancies, the outcome is dismal; incidence is rapidly increasing, and mechanistic understanding is limited. We observed abnormal proliferation of both biliary epithelium and hepatocytes in mice after genetic manipulation of Yes-associated protein, a transcription coactivator. Here, we comprehensively documented Yes-associated protein expression in the human liver and primary liver cancers. We showed that nuclear Yes-associated protein expression is significantly increased in human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. We found that increased Yes-associated protein levels in hepatocellular carcinoma are due to multiple mechanisms including gene amplification and transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. Survivin, a member of the inhibitors-of-apoptosis protein family, has been reported as an independent prognostic factor for poor survival in both hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. We found that nuclear Yes-associated protein expression correlates significantly with nuclear Survivin expression for both intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, using mice engineered to conditionally overexpress Yes-associated protein in the liver, we found that Survivin messenger RNA expression depends upon Yes-associated protein levels. Our findings suggested that Yes-associated protein contributes to primary liver tumorigenesis and likely mediates its oncogenic effects through modulating Survivin expression." ;

      dc:description "Background/Aim: To determine the yield of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) in combination with immunostains in diagnosing unusual solid pancreatic masses (USPM) in comparison with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (ACP). Patients and Methods: All EUS-FNA of solid pancreatic masses performed with a 22-gauge needle were included. Data on clinical presentations, mass characteristics, presence of pancreatitis, yield of tissue, and final diagnosis were compared between the two groups. On site cytopathology was provided and additional passes were requested to perform immunostains. Results : Two hundred and twenty-nine cases with either adenocarcinoma or USPM were included. The median age of the cohort was 65 years. ACP (210/229, 92%) accounted for the majority of the cases. The USPM included neuroendocrine (NET) masses (n=13), metastatic renal carcinoma (n=3), metastatic melanoma (n=1), lymphoma (n=1), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (n=1). Subjects with ACP were significantly more likely to present with loss of weight (P=0.02) or obstructive jaundice (P<0.001). Subjects with ACP were more likely to have suspicious/atypical FNA biopsy results as compared with USPM (10% vs 0%). The sensitivity of EUS-FNA with immunostains was 93% in ACP as compared with 100% in USPM. Diagnostic accuracy was higher in USPM as compared with ACP (100% vs 93%). Conclusions: EUS-FNA using a 22-gauge needle with immunostains has excellent diagnostic yield in patients with USPMs, which is comparable if not superior to the yield in pancreatic adenocarcinoma." ;

Initially, Civil and Canon Law, Literature, and Medicine were among the subjects taught at the Studium, and various famous scholars were invited to teach there: Giovanni Bocaccio was asked to lecture on the Divine Comedy. 

However, the importance of the Studium was fully recognized with a Bull by Popo Clemente VI in 1349, in which he officially authorised the Studium to grant regular degrees, extended the Privilegia maxima, and established that the first Italian Faculty of Theology would be in Florence. 

In 1364, with Emperor Carlo VII, the Florentine Studium became an Imperial University. However, when Lorenzo the Magnificent gained control of Florence and much of Tuscany, the Studium was moved to Pisa, in 1473. Carlo VIII moved it back to Florence from 1497-1515, but with the return of the Medici family it was once again transferred to Pisa. 

In spite of these moves, many teaching activities continued in Florence, and scientific research found substantial support in the various Academies of the time, like the Crusca and the Cimento. 

Only in 1859, when the Grand Duke was exiled, were all these separate teaching activities reunited in a suitable system called the Istituto di Studi Pratici e di Perfezionamento; a year later this was recognized as a full fledged university by the Government of Unified Italy. 

In 1923, with a special Act of Parliament the Instututo was officially denominated a University. Later, the new University was organized into the various faculties: Agriculture, Architecture, Arts, Economics, Education, Law, Mathematics, Physical and Natural Sciences, Medicine and Surgery, Pharmacy, and Political Science. The Faculty of Engineering was added to the 10 faculties in 1970 and the Faculty of Psychology in 2002.""" ;

Since its creation in 1909 and its state approval as a foundation in 1921, the Institut Curie has brought together scientists and physicians with a common goal: to defeat cancer. Marie Curie's legacy of the “Curie model” is defined by the seamless interface between cutting-edge basic research and innovative and quality healthcare. Its originality stems from its unique approach in a unique setting, the bringing together of scientists, nurses and patients so as to expedite access to diagnosis and new treatments. The Curie model benefits patients and inspires other institutes in France and beyond. 

The Research Center of the Institut Curie is one of the most important in Europe and the largest in France dedicated to cancer research. It houses 61 joint Institut Curie - CNRS or INSERM research groups whose common goal is to increase knowledge and ameliorate patient management using state-of-the-art technology platforms. 

The Technology Transfer Department spearheads translational research and forms a vital link between basic research and healthcare, thus expediting transfer of scientific innovations from bench to bedside. It is developing new diagnostic techniques and more effective and safer approaches to treatment. 

The Institut Curie Hospital is a private organization which contributes to the public health system. With its diagnostic (imaging, pathology, laboratory testing) and therapeutic (surgery, radiotherapy, medical treatments, support treatment) armory, it blends technology and care, and ensures national and international dissemination of medical innovations. 
A pioneer in a number of conservative treatments, the Hospital is a reference center throughout the world for breast cancer, pediatric tumors, sarcomas, eye tumors and numerous advanced techniques such as oncogenetics and precision radiotherapy (curietherapy, proton therapy). 

The Institut Curie has a Scientific Board whose remit is to guide its research policy and validate scientific choices. The Board's members are internationally recognized leaders in research and medicine. 

Various departments ensure that the Institut Curie runs smoothly: financial management, development, communications, fundraising, legal, working hand in hand with the institutional services. 
Aiming at excellence and innovation

The Institut Curie's fame is rooted in the excellence of its scientific and medical work, carried out by highly skilled personnel, and also in the quality of its technological platforms and equipment. The Institut itself funds ambitious research projects, their transfer to medical applications, and diagnostic and therapeutic innovation. 
Through its innovative programs and the dissemination of their findings around the world, Institut Curie scientists and clinicians contribute to the development of new treatments.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """Our laboratory obtained data from studies of DC phagosomes and cross-presentation using K/O and mutant mouse strains. Cross presentation is the process by which Dendritic cells (DC) phagocytose pathogens or dying cell fragments, and present proteolytic peptides derived from these antigens in association with MHC class I molecules. The reasons why DCs are the only antigen presenting cells that efficiently cross present antigens are not well understood. 

We have demonstrated that the NADPH oxidase NOX2 is recruited to DC early phagosomes mediating a sustained production of low levels of reactive oxygen species and causing a maintained alkalynization of the phagosomal lumen. DCs lacking NOX2 show increased antigen degradation due to an enhanced phagosome acidification. As a result, the efficiency of in vitro and in vivo antigen cross presentation is significantly reduced in NOX2-deficient DCs. We also show that DCs derived from ashen mice, which are defective for the small GTPase Rab27a, fail to cross present antigens efficiently, due to increased phagosome acidification and antigen degradation. This defect in Rab27a-deficient DCs results from the impaired recruitment to phagosomes of the NOX2 membrane components. Therefore phagosomal alkalinization by NOX2 is controlled by Rab27a, and is required for efficient cross presentation in DCs.

In vivo, different subsets of DCs are considered with different competences to cross present antigens. The reasons why CD8+ DCs subset is the only one that efficiently carry out this phenomenon are not well understood. We have found that only CD8+ DCs display a NOX2 activity selectively localized to in phagosomes, causing alkalynization and preventing Ag degradation. In contrast, CD8- DCs, which exhibit higher total NOX2 activity than their counterparts but lack phagosomal ROS production, acidify their phagosomes causing more important antigen degradation which is unfavourable for cross presentation. Rac proteins are key components of NOX2 activation. Interestingly, we found that differential expression of Rac1 and Rac2 in the two DCs subsets, are responsible for the differential localization of ROS production in both cell types. """ ;

The Jozef Stefan Institute is the leading Slovenian scientific research institute, covering a broad spectrum of basic and applied research. The staff of more than 850 specializes in natural sciences, life sciences and engineering. The subjects concern production and control technologies, communication and computer technologies, knowledge technologies, biotechnologies, new materials, environmental technologies, nanotechnologies, and nuclear engineering. The mission of the Jozef Stefan Institute is the accumulation and dissemination of knowledge at the frontiers of natural science and technology to the benefit of society at large through the pursuit of education, learning, research, and development of high technology at the highest international levels of excellence. The Institute was founded in 1949. Initially established as an institute for Physics within the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, it is today involved in a wide variety of fields of both scientific and economic interest. After close to 60 years of scientific achievement, the Institute has become part of the image of Slovenia. The basic goals of the Institute are to provide expert scientific and applied output in the form of processes, products and consultancy, and to produce well-trained young scientists. The underlying philosophy is that these objectives can be achieved only if based on international class scientific research. With this in mind, the in-house research has been reinforced by building strong links to universities, other research institutions and industry. The Institute is closely connected with the Slovenian universities, where many scientists who initially developed their research talents at the Institute have been appointed to teaching posts, while still retaining their research positions or research teams at the Institute. Since 1985 more than 800 postgraduate students have gained their Ph.D. degrees at the Institute. Close collaboration with the Slovenian University Medical Centre has resulted in the development of medical equipment (tomography, electrical stimulators and appliances), the provision of isotopes for clinical research and treatment of patients, and the introduction of new research techniques and diagnostic methods into clinical medicine. The Institute devotes a considerable amount of effort to transferring the results of its research and knowledge to productive applications and to the market. 

ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR AND STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY 

Research areas:
- Protein biochemistry 
- Proteolysis and its regulation by inhibitors 
- Programmed cell death 
- Regulation of immune response 
- Protein folding and aggregation 
- Structural biology 
- Physiological and pathophysiological role of proteases in cancer, inflammation and neurodegenerative disorders 
- Proteomics 
- Chemical genomics 
- Nanobiology 
- Development of computational methods for structural biology 
- Biotechnological methods for production of recombinant proteins and antibodies 

The major goals of our research are to characterize the individual proteases (primarily from the cathepsin family) and their inhibitors (stefins, cystatins and related proteins) and to unravel the molecular mechanisms of processes leading to programmed cell death or regulating the immune response of the organism. In addition, our research is focused towards understanding the roles of proteases in various pathological processes, such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, and different neurological disorders (Huntington disease, …). An important area of research is also formation of amyloid fibers. For a better understanding of these processes a number of tools are needed, and therefore we are developing production of various antibodies and recombinant proteins (proteases and their inhibitors). We also participate in the development of activity-based probes for proteases suitable for work in cellular and in vivo models, and for testing pharmacologically-relevant compounds. In addition, we have a key role in establishing a center for proteomic research, which would cover the needs of whole Slovenia. One of the important areas is also understanding of the 3-D structures of biological macromolecules and their complexes at the atomic level, thereby linking the sequencing information with the mechanism of molecule action. In this way, the research is focused in target identification and validation, which are key areas of research in the field of biomedicine in connection with biotechnology. """ ;

In their labs, located in a landscaped campus environment, they share a vision: To better understand nature and our place within it. Inquisitiveness is their predominant trait. It is this curiosity that propelled Homo sapiens up the slope of evolution. It is this driving curiosity that sees man -- and woman -- through their greatest discoveries. It is the force which pushed earliest civilization to develop agriculture, to learn the hows of constructing shelter, to create the written word, to harness electricity to the wagon of industry and commerce, to contemplate far-off galaxies, to find the cure for disease, to form new materials, and to decipher the genetic code stamped on all living things, be they plant or animal. The desire to continue in this forward stride is the force behind every Institute scientist's efforts to penetrate realms formerly incomprehensible to humankind. And what dwells in these domains? The unknown. The only certainty: revelation encountered along their path.

The National Blood Service is not to be confused with the National Health Service.

We are an integral part of the NHS, and we guarantee to deliver blood, blood components, blood products and tissues from our 15 blood centres to anywhere in England and North Wales.

Naturally, we also ensure that the blood we supply is properly screened and is safe for patients. Every year we collect, test, process, store and issue 2.1 million blood donations. We depend entirely on voluntary donations from the general public, and try to encourage our existing donors to give three times a year. (It's amazing what the promise of a free cup of tea and some biscuits will do...)

But we also have a number of other functions. Such as continually carrying out new research into improving the safety of blood. And new ways it can be used to help save more lives.

We also provide specialist medical advice and clinical support to hospitals, as well as educating and training transfusion medicine specialists. It's a huge undertaking. But we're dedicated to keeping Britain's blood supply moving.

Our core purpose 
To save and improve patients' lives.

Our mission
We will deliver world-class services, building ever stronger partnerships with donors and the healthcare community

Our values 
We value people
• We listen and communicate clearly
• We strive to meet the needs of all our customers
• We recognise the achievements of others

We trust people
• To work to the highest possible standards of safety and quality
• To take responsibility for solving problems
• To embrace change for the better

We encourage people
• To be creative and innovative
• To work together to get things right
• To enjoy themselves and celebrate success.""" ;

We have previously generated a monoclonal antibody, 2C44, that reacted to a peptide derived from the Leishmania LACK protein bound to I-Ad MHC class II molecules. We have successfully used the 2C44 mAb to visualize LACK-presenting DCs in mice infected with the L. major. In 2007, we have attempted to identify the APCs that are responsible for the development of immune tolerance in mice that have been breast-fed by antigen-exposed lactating mothers. Recent experiments performed in our laboratory have shown that the exposure of a mother to an airborne antigen during lactation impacts asthma development in their progeny. We found that airborne allergens were efficiently transferred from the mother to the neonate through the milk and that this transfer resulted in the development of antigen-specific tolerance. Breastfeeding-induced tolerance did not require the transfer of immunoglobulins, relied on the presence of TGF-beta during lactation and was mediated by regulatory CD4+ T lymphocytes. Adoptive transfer experiments of LACK-specific TCR transgenic T cells into newborn mice breastfed by LACK-exposed mothers demonstrated that LACK was readily processed and presented to T cells in the neonate.

We then investigated whether the immune status of the mother has an effect on the development of tolerance in the breast-fed mouse. We found that mice breastfed on allergen exposed allergic mothers were more resistant to allergic airway inflammation as compared to those breastfed on non allergic mothers. This phenomenon was demonstrated  to be dependent on the presence of allergen-specific Immunoglobulins (Ig) in the breastmilk of allergic mothers and on the transfer of immunecomplexes across the intestinal barrier of the newborn. In order to identify the APCs that were responsible for the development of this state of immune tolerance, we aimed to generate a transgenic mouse that express a recombinant fluorescent protein in the mammary glands, an approach that should result in high levels of expression of the fluorescent protein in the milk. We thus should be able to detect the cells that capture, degrade and present this antigen to T cells. Since we had previously generated a monoclonal antibody, 2C44, that reacts to a peptide derived from the Leishmania LACK protein bound to I-Ad MHC class II molecules, we chose to use LACK as a model antigen in these experiments. We have thus prepared two plasmids coding for LACK linked to either eGFP or mCherry fluorescent proteins, under the control of the beta-casein promoter. These constructs have been injected into fertilized eggs and transgenic animals are expected for march 2009. The characterization of antigen presenting cells will be performed using FACS analysis or confocal microscopy.""" ;

      dc:description "Adoptive cell therapy of metastatic melanoma with autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is clinically effective, but TIL production can be challenging. Here we describe a simplified method for initial TIL culture and rapid expansion in gas-permeable flasks. TIL were initially cultured from tumor digests and fragments in 40 mL capacity flasks with a 10 cm gas-permeable silicone bottom, G-Rex10. A TIL rapid expansion protocol (REP) was developed using 500 mL capacity flasks with a 100 cm gas-permeable silicone bottom, G-Rex100. TIL growth was successfully initiated in G-Rex10 flasks from tumor digests from 13 of 14 patients and from tumor fragments in all 11 tumor samples tested. TIL could then be expanded to 8-10×10 cells in a 2-step REP that began by seeding 5×10 TIL into a G-Rex100 flask, followed by expansion at day 7 into 3 G-Rex100 flasks. To obtain the 30-60×10 cells used for patient treatment, we seeded 6 G-Rex100 flasks with 5×10 cells and expanded into 18 G-Rex100 flasks. Large-scale TIL REP in gas-permeable flasks requires approximately 9-10 L of media, about 3-4 times less than other methods. In conclusion, TIL initiation and REP in gas-permeable G-Rex flasks require fewer total vessels, less media, less incubator space, and less labor than initiation and REP in 24-well plates, tissue culture flasks, and bags. TIL culture in G-Rex flasks will facilitate the production of TIL at the numbers required for patient treatment at most cell processing laboratories." ;

      rdfs:comment """My laboratory obtained data from a continued analysis of the ability of invariant NKT (iNKT) cells to assist priming of antigen specific T and B cell responses. We have carried out three complementary lines of research:

1) We have demonstrated that activation of human DC by Toll like receptor ligands (TLR-L) modulates the lipid biosynthetic pathway, resulting in enhanced recognition of CD1d-associated lipids by iNKT cells. 

2) We have clarified the mechanisms by which CD1d-restricted lymphocytes translate T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of lipids with similar group heads into distinct biological responses. Using a soluble iNKT TCR and a newly engineered antibody specific for alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer)-human CD1d (hCD1d) complexes, we measured the affinity of binding of iNKT TCR to hCD1d molecules loaded with a panel of alpha-GalCer analogues and assessed the rate of dissociation of alpha-GalCer and alpha-GalCer analogues from hCD1d molecules. We have extended this analysis by studying iNKT cell synapse formation and iNKT cell activation by the same panel of alpha-GalCer analogues. Our results indicate the unique role of the lipid chain occupying the hCD1d F' channel in modulating TCR binding affinity to hCD1d-lipid complexes, the formation of stable immunological synapse, and cell activation. Our results indicate a general mechanism by which lipid-specific lymphocytes are capable of recognizing both the group head and the length of lipid antigens, ensuring greater specificity of antigen recognition.

3) We demonstrated that pathogen-derived signals to DC mediated via TLRs can be modulated by activated iNKT cells 
(Hermans et al, 2007). DC maturation induced in vivo with any one of a variety of TLR ligands was greatly improved through simultaneous administration of the iNKT cell ligand alpha-galactosylceramide. DC isolated from animals treated simultaneously with TLR and iNKT cell ligands were potent stimulators of naive T cells in vitro compared with DC from animals treated with the ligands individually. Injection of protein Ags with both stimuli resulted in significantly improved T cell and Ab responses to coadministered protein Ags over TLR stimulation alone. Ag-specific CD8(+) T cell responses induced in the presence of the TLR4 ligand monophosphoryl lipid A and alpha-galactosylceramide showed faster proliferation kinetics, and increased effector function, than those induced with either ligand alone. Human DC exposed to TLR ligands and activated iNKT cells in vitro had enhanced expression of maturation markers, suggesting that a cooperative action of TLR ligands and iNKT cells on DC function is a generalizable phenomenon across species. 

These studies highlight the potential for manipulating the interactions between TLR ligands and iNKT cell activation in the design of effective vaccine adjuvants. """ ;

Here we describe the generation and preclinical evaluation of 3 new recombinant ALVAC(2) poxviruses vCP2264, vCP2291, and vCP2292 for their ability to induce the desired cellular immune responses against the encoded melanoma-associated antigens. This was done either in HLA-A2/K transgenic mice or using in vitro antigen-presentation studies. These studies demonstrated that the vaccine was able to induce HLA-A*0201-restricted T-cell responses against gp100 and NY-ESO-1, detectable directly ex vivo, in HLA-A2/K-transgenic mice. The in vitro antigen presentation studies, in the absence of appropriate animal models, demonstrated that target cells infected with the vaccine construct were lysed by MAGE-1, MAGE-3 or MART-1 peptide-specific T cells. These data indicate that ALVAC(2)-encoded melanoma-associated antigens can be properly processed and presented to induce antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses. To enhance the immunogenicity of the melanoma antigens, a TRIad of COstimulatory Molecules (TRICOM) were also cloned into all 3 vectors. Increased in vitro proliferation and IFN-γ production was observed with all ALVAC(2) poxviruses encoding TRICOM, confirming the immune-enhancing effect of the ALVAC-encoded TRICOM. These studies demonstrated that all components of the vaccine were functionally active and provide a rationale for moving this candidate vaccine to the clinic." ;

      dc:description "BACKGROUND: Atypical lentiginous nevus (of the elderly) is a peculiar form of dysplastic nevus. Clinically, this condition can resemble malignant melanoma and histologically, it has a lentiginous pattern with variable degrees of atypia and an absence of dermal nests. These features may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of lentigo maligna melanoma or lentiginous melanoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed 14 cases of atypical lentiginous nevus diagnosed at the dermatology department of Hospital General de Valencia in Valencia, Spain between December 2007 and March 2009. We studied the clinical and histopathologic features of the lesions after hematoxylin-eosin, Melan-A, and Ki-67 staining and compared our results to data reported in the literature. RESULTS: Four (28%) of the 14 patients (7 men, 7 women) were under 50 years of age. Clinically, most of the lesions (8/14) resembled atypical nevi and they were all located on the back. Histologically, they all had irregular lentiginous epidermal hyperplasia, with a proliferation of individual melanocytes only in the basal layer of the epidermis and an absence of dermal nests. Focal upward migration of melanocytes into the epidermis was present in just 4 cases. All the lesions had cellular atypia, which was moderate in 85% of cases. The Ki-67 proliferation index was low (<5%) in all the lesions analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical lentiginous nevi, which can be classified as atypical pigmented lesions with a lentiginous pattern, may clinically and histologically resemble melanoma. Our findings support earlier reports that both clinical and histologic findings may suggest a diagnosis of dysplastic nevus. All of the patients in our series are healthy and free of recurrence after 18 months or longer." ;

      rdfs:comment """The objective of the creation of the Institut de Transplantation et de Recherche en Transplantation (ITERT) was to promote a medical-biological dynamic entity capable of promoting transplantation medicine and its research to a level of European excellence. The ITERT was created in 1991 based on article L6.146-8 of the code of public health offering the possibility to experiment with new forms of medical organisation linking, for example, a clinical activity and a biological activity. 
The ITERT is located in the Jean Monnet building on the Hôtel-Dieu site of Nantes University Hospital where it occupies different floors including the basement (animal section), the garden level (consultations, secretariat, medical offices, conference room, DIVAT –database-and annex of Etablissement Français des Greffes (French Transplant Organisation), the upper ground floor (Nephrology and Clinical Immunology Department, including acute haemodialysis care unit and graft intensive care), and the first floor (INSERM UMR 643). Only the Large Animal Laboratory, for obvious technical reasons, is located in the Hôtel-Dieu away from Jean Monnet. The main part of the clinical and biological activity of the ITERT is therefore grouped together on one single site: the Jean Monnet building of the Hôtel-Dieu. 
The ITERT is one of the two leading European centres in the number of transplanted kidneys (175 in 2004). For the last three years, the ITERT is one of the two leading French centre for pancreas transplantation (31 in 2004). The length of the waiting list of patients for transplants at the ITERT is 427 for kidneys and 36 for the pancreas. 

Since 1991, the ITERT has published 440 scientific articles and 264 of them were original ones. 

The ITERT has an international scientific council and has been supported since its creation by the Fondation Progreffe, a charitable foundation of companies. 

The ITERT has contributed to the creation of three companies in the domain of biotechnology and healthcare databanks. 

The ITERT is part of a local biomedical institute of research (Institut Fédératif de Recherche 26) which gathers more of 650 scientific personnel. 

The ITERT has close links to OUEST-Génopole through their common facilities (rat transgenesis and transcriptome). A center for regenerative medicine (Centre d’Investigations Clinique en Biothérapie) has recently been created in Nantes University Hospital and the ITERT was one of the initiators of the proposal. The recently awarded Atlantic Biotherapies National Competitivity Pole encompasses academic and industrial partners in this area, including the ITERT (President, J-P. Soulillou).""" ;

Treatment of neonatal mice with recombinant IFNalpha has a short-term, FL-independent and a long-term, FL-dependent protective effect against HSV-1. In mice lacking FL, neonatal resistance against HSV-1 is very low and DC numbers in the spleen are reduced. The treatment of these mice with rIFNalpha at day 6 resulted in an increased resistance against infection with HSV-1 at day 7. In C57BL/6 mice, treatment with rIFNalpha at birth induced both FL and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) that resulted in enhanced resistance against HSV-1 at day 7. In contrast, in mice lacking FL, IFNalpha treatment at birth did not influence splenic cell composition and had no effect on viral protection. The transfer of pDC to mice lacking FL enhanced viral resistance." ;

      dc:description "Evidence for the in vitro lymphocyte response against autologous melanoma has been accumulating over the past 10 years, leading to the identification of numerous melanoma-associated antigens recognised by T cells. These antigens are targets for specific immunotherapy protocols. However, their expression is heterogeneous during tumour progression and may contribute to therapeutic escape mechanisms and disease progression. This study was designed to chart the importance of these escape mechanisms, and to assess the relationship between gene expression and the clinical profile (especially survival data) of patients with melanoma. We studied the expression of certain melanoma genes in tissue biopsies from 202 patients using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The evaluated genes were Melan-A, tyrosinase, Na-17A, MAGE-1, MAGE-3 and Ny-ESO-1. We then correlated the results to the patients' survival data. 202 samples (cutaneous, nodal and visceral biopsies) were analysed by RT-PCR. No relationship was found between clinical data and gene expression. No relationship was found between survival data and gene expression, when samples of all stages were combined in the analysis. However, interactions between gene expression and disease stage were significant. When stage III samples alone were considered, MAGE-3 expression alone or in association with the expression of the other tumour-specific genes was found to be significantly associated with a higher disease-free survival (respectively, P = 0.0349; 0.007). Our results provided no evidence for a relationship between gene expression and clinical data, or between gene expression and survival data. However, with regard to certain sub-groups, such as stage III samples, tumour gene expression was significantly associated with survival." ;

F. de Godoy (Post-doc) and Jesper V. Olsen (PhD student). Recently, our lab has been developing new techniques in quantitative proteomics and has also acquired new instrumentation to assess these types of questions in depth. This, of course, involves a lot of optimization and, consequently, large amounts of sample. However, to obtain high numbers of dendritic cells is not a trivial process, and can also be very expensive. For that reason, we have been using other model systems, like yeast, for all the general optimization steps, to have a basic set-up before we perform the experiments with the DCs." ;

A 53-year-old man came to our Department for a left adrenal mass discovered incidentally. Biochemical and imaging findings were suspicious for a pheochromocytoma. The patient underwent a laparoscopic left adrenalectomy. A well-circumscribed 5.5-cm mass was removed. It was composed of adrenal cells intimately admixed with pheochromocytes. Immunohistochemical studies were positive both for cortical cells (inibin-α, synaptophysine and melan-A) and medullary cells (S-100 and chromogranine A). Final pathology was of corticomedullary mixed tumor (CMT). CMT is a rare tumor with 14 cases previously reported in literature, with wide variable biochemical behavior, such as his radiological and pathological features. Prevalence and actual malignant potential are yet unknown to our knowledge." ;

We have studied long peptides which were covalently conjugated to either the TLR2 ligand or TLR9 ligand, Pam3CysSK4 or CpG, respectively have been used to study the uptake, antigen presentation, and induction of specific T-cells. A pronounced enhancement in antigen presentation by DC in vitro was facilitated by the conjugated peptides compared to peptide alone, or peptide mixed with the free TLR ligand. Importantly, direct injection of the conjugates or pre-loading of the conjugates onto dendritic cells followed by injection into naïve mice, lead to a robust induction of specific CD8 T-cells, as detected by tetramers staining, compared to mice injected with the peptide mixed with the free TLR ligand. 

With regard to TLR2 ligands, we have investigated the behaviour of two diastereomers of the TLR-2 ligand Pam3CSK4 (Pam) derivatives, namely the R- and S-epimers at C-2 of the glycerol moiety. In this respect we have chemically coupled  either the R-epimer of the Pam3CSK4 or the S-epimer of the Pam3CSK4 to long peptides containing a CTL epitope. We found that the Pam(R)-conjugates lead to better activation of dendritic cells than the Pam(S)-conjugates as judged by higher IL-12 secretion, up-regulation of relevant markers for dendritic cell maturation. In contrast, both epimers were internalized equally efficient in a clathrin-dependent manner indicating no qualitative difference in the uptake of the two stereoisomeric Pam-conjugates. We conclude that the enhanced DC activation is due to enhanced TLR-2 triggering by the Pam(R) conjugate in contrast to the Pam(S) conjugate. Importantly, induction of specific CD8+ T-cells was significantly higher in mice injected with the Pam(R)-conjugates compared to mice injected with the Pam(S)-conjugate. 

These results show that chemically well-defined TLR ligand conjugates induce a strong immune response, significantly more effective than combining the free peptide and the TLR ligand. By combining efficient antigen targeting and DC maturation, TLR ligand conjugates are promising vehicles to deliver antigens via the cross-presentation pathway.""" ;

A shave biopsy from the cheek of a 58-year-old man demonstrated a thin invasive melanoma of 0.3 mm thickness with a less than 2-mm-wide intra-epidermal component. Below this melanocytic lesion, but not contiguous with it, there was a transected S-100-positive and Melan-A-negative spindle cell proliferation. Upon re-excision, no residuum of conventional melanoma was identified, but a residual spindle cell neoplasm that was 4 mm in diameter, nodular, well-circumscribed, cytologically bland, and S-100 positive was noted. At our consensus conference, our group favored neurofibroma but agreed that spindle cell melanoma could not be excluded based on histopathologic features alone. To further address the differential diagnosis, we performed CD34 staining that demonstrated lack of a CD34 fingerprint. We also completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization, which demonstrated gain of chromosome 6p, loss of 6p and gain of 7. These two methods of analysis support a diagnosis of spindle cell melanoma." ;

      rdfs:comment """We are progressing steadily towards the delivery of a standardized method for the immuno-monitoring of DC vaccination trials using a finite number of defined tumor antigens. Our starting point was the method that we had developed previously to estimate blood frequencies of CD8 T lymphocytes against one defined antigenic peptide. It was based on an in vitro restimulation of blood lymphocytes with the peptide and growth factors over two weeks followed by detection with the appropriate HLA class I tetramer. In order to estimate frequencies of responding cells, these mixed lymphocyte peptide cultures (MLPC) are conducted in limiting dilution condition. We have validated two important modifications to this protocol. 

i)  MLPC/tetramer with multiple peptides presented by HLA class I molecules. We now have a stimulation method that can be used for up to 8 antigenic peptides simultaneously, all presented by HLA class I molecules. To avoid competition between the peptides for HLA binding, the initial stimulation of the PBMC is carried out by dividing the initial population into 8 fractions, each of which is pulsed with one peptide, and pooling these individually pulsed fractions before the distribution into the limiting dilution microcultures. For tetramer detection, we obtain similar results with either of two methods. The first is simply to mix all tetramers, a procedure that, if each reagent is carefully titrated, does not generate a disturbing non specific labeling. A positive microculture has then to be retested individually with each tetramer. The advantage of this procedure is that the initial screening has to be carried out only once. This procedure is applicable when the proportion of positive microcultures is low. The second method is to carry out the screening with mixes of three tetramers with an overlap of one. For tetramers 1-8 this gives 1,2,3 and 3,4,5 and 5,6,7 and 7,8,1. Here the initial screening uses four labelings, but one can immediately determine which antigen is recognized in which microculture. 

ii) MLPC/tetramer including a peptide presented by HLA class II molecules. With the availability of a new type of HLA class II tetramer, consisting of recombinant HLA-DP4 molecules folded with the MAGE-A3 peptide presented by DP4, we could test whether the MLPC/tetramer method could be used also for a vaccine peptide recognized by CD4 T cells. We found out that the addition of the MAGE-3.DP4 peptide to the mix of 8 peptides described above allowed for the stimulation, in the same microcultures, of both CD4 and CD8 peptide-specific responder cells. Tetramer detection was as sensitive as for the class I reagents and could be performed simultaneously. This improvement could be very useful for all the trials that combine class I and class II antigenic peptides.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """Using the MLPC/tetramer method described last year, we obtained data by pursuing the immunological monitoring of melanoma patients vaccinated with 4 peptides (MAGE-A3, gp100, NA17 and tyrosinase) presented by HLA-A2. We measured responses to these peptides injected with Montanide, but did not know whether the Montanide adjuvant was important for these T cell responses. Indeed, melanoma patients may mount spontaneous responses to these antigenic peptides. We therefore injected the same peptides without adjuvant, and no response was observed. We conclude that Montanide had a clear adjuvant effect for the CD8 T cell responses measured against these four peptides.

Tumor regressions have been observed in a small proportion of melanoma patients vaccinated with a MAGE-A3 peptide presented by HLA-A1, administered as peptide, ALVAC canarypox virus containing a MAGE-A3 minigene, or peptide-pulsed dendritic cells (DC). There was a correlation between tumor regression and detection of anti-MAGE-3.A1 CTL responses. These responses were monoclonal and often of a very low magnitude after vaccination with peptide or ALVAC, and usually polyclonal and of a higher magnitude after DC vaccination. These results suggested that, at least in some patients, surprisingly few anti-MAGE-3.A1 T cells could initiate a tumor regression process. 

To understand the role of these T cells, we performed a functional analysis of anti-MAGE-3.A1 CTL clones derived from vaccinated patients who displayed tumor regression. The functional avidities of these CTL clones, evaluated in lysis assays, were surprisingly low, suggesting that high avidity was not part of the putative capability of these CTL to trigger tumor rejection. Most anti-MAGE-3.A1 CTL clones obtained after DC vaccination, but not after peptide or ALVAC vaccination, produced IL-10. Transcript profiling confirmed this result and indicated that about 20 genes, including CD40L, prostaglandin D2 synthase, granzyme K and granzyme H, were differentially expressed between the anti-MAGE-3.A1 CTL clones derived from patients vaccinated with peptide-ALVAC or with peptide-pulsed DC. These results indicate that the modality of vaccination with a tumor-specific antigen influences the differentiation pathway of the anti-vaccine CD8 T cells, which may have an impact on their capacity to trigger a tumor rejection response.

This data is extremely relevant for the design and performance of the immunomonitoring of the new clinical trial WP19.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """We are collecting immunological data from a melanoma patient, aiming to identify the antigen(s) recognized by T cells from this patient that experienced an outstanding response to immunotherapy. This patient received several adoptive T cell transfers and regressed from stage IV melanoma to a disease free state and has remained tumor free for several years. In a collaboration with Dr. O. Winqvist, Karolinska Institute, we attempted to improve the adoptive transfer protocol by stimulating T cells with monocyte derived DC pulsed with tumor lysate, instead of simply adding tumor lysate into PBMC cultures. T cells raised exhibited some tumor reactivity and outgrowth of a distinct T cell population could be observed. We intented to identify the target antigen recognized by the tumor reactive T cells in order to further improve T cell stimulations and to possibly complement treatment with DC vaccination. 

We then evaluated the capacity of autologous DC and HEK293 cells transfected with relevant HLA alleles to function as T cell targets in Elispot assays upon transfection with tumor antigen encoding plasmids. Due to strong background from the autologous DC we decided that HEK293 transfected with one HLA-allele at a time plus simultaneously transfected with up to 5 tumor antiges would be optimal to screen for antigen specificity in the patients T cells. However, during a second T cell culture to expand large numbers of T cells for this screening procedure a drastic expansion of regulatory T cells was observed. Since no sufficient number of T cells could be expanded the screening was not performed. The reason for the altered phenotype/function of the expanded T cells from the second bleeding of this patient is currently not known.""" ;

Therapeutic vaccinations strongly delay tumor growth or even prevent tumors from growing out. By depleting CD4+ and CD8+ cell populations prior to tumor challenge, CD8+ cells were identified as the main effector cells involved. Importantly, DCs pre-loaded in vitro with ICs are at least 1000-fold more potent than ICs injected directly into mice or DCs loaded with the same amount of non-complexed protein. FcgammaRs on DCs were required for efficient priming of Ag-specific CD8+ cells in vivo and induction of tumor protection. These findings show that targeting ICs via the activating FcgammaRs to DCs in vitro is superior to direct IC vaccination to induce protective tumor immunity in vivo. """ ;

      rdfs:comment """A comprehensive protein inventory of clinical grade immature and cytokine cocktail matured (Il-6, IL-1 beta, TNF alpha, PGE2; 48 hours) monocyte derived human dendritic cells (DC) from a healthy donor has been established by using high accuracy, high sensitivity protein identification technology. We have identified 2794 proteins in DCs by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Prior to MS analysis, DC were lysed and divided into a soluble fraction containing cytosolic proteins and into an insoluble fraction enriched for membrane containing proteins.  Highly complex protein mixtures of DC cellular fractions were separated on 1 D SDS-PAGE into 20 gel slices (fractions), followed by in-gel digestion with trypsin. Purified tryptic peptides were analysed in triplicate by LC-MS/MS using a linear ion trap/ Fourier Transform (LTQ-FT) hybrid mass spectrometer. 

Iterative calibration algorithms were used to achieve a final, absolute mass accuracy of better than 10 parts per million (p.p.m.) for all peptide ions. These high-accuracy spectra were searched against a human protein database, using MASCOT probability-based scoring in which the fragment ions are matched against the calculated fragments of all tryptic peptides from the human sequences. Additional constraints were set by searches against a reversed human database to minimize false positive protein identifications. These criteria resulted in a list of 2794 unique proteins that were identified with high confidence, comprising of 2623 proteins detected in immature DCs, 1896 proteins in mature DCs, and 1725 proteins in both cell types. Differences were quantified by the exponentially modified Protein Abundance Index (emPAI) method, a label free spectral counting procedure for determining relative protein amounts of LC-MS/MS data.

Protein expression profiles were compared with gene expression profiles generated by microarray technology (M2.2). In total, we could map 96 percent of the detected proteins to expressed genes for the immature DCs and 90 percent for the mature DCs. A Pearson correlation analysis revealed for both cell types, good correlations, respectively 0.57 and 0.50. These correlations are in good agreement with similar correlation studies, where correlation coefficients approximately range from 0.2-0.7 for large scale datasets.  These studies include quantitative highly accurate proteomic data generated by chemically-or metabolically-labeled approaches.  Therefore, we conclude that our data contains sufficient quantitative information to define subsets of up- and down-regulated proteins for functional analysis. We find 202 proteins upregulated by more than 2 fold in mature DCs and 463 proteins upregulated in immature DCs. 

Functional annotation by gene ontology classification and pathway analysis by several bioinformatics approaches have been performed. Preliminary results obtained from querying DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) and Ontologizer (http://www.charite.de/ch/medgen/ontologizer/) show statistically significant enrichment for immunological-relevant signaling pathways and immunology-related GO terms of the upregulated proteins in mature DCs.""" ;

In addition, CD83 mRNA-electroporated DC are stronger T cell stimulators. However, CD83 overexpression on Melan-A/MART-1-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) circumvents the need for CD83 expression on DC. Co-culture of immature DC with TIL or K562 cells overexpressing CD83 results in the production of enhanced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas this production is less pronounced or even absent in co-cultures with non-modified TIL or K562 cells.

      rdfs:comment """We performed experiments to set up the optimal conditions for both transient transfection of synthetic siRNAs and lentiviral transduction of shRNAs into DC. 

To optimize transfection efficiency, while minimizing toxicity, non targeting FITC-conjugated siRNA were transfected in two different experimental settings: 

a) fresh monocytes and 
b) immature DCs (iDCs) obtained from monocytes in the presence of GM-CSF/IL-4. 

In both experimental settings a considerably high transfection efficiency (up to 75%) was achieved in the absence of significant cell death. Moreover, the percentage of siRNA-FITC+ cells did not decline with time (up to 5 days post-transfection) suggesting high siRNA stability inside the DCs, in agreement with previously published data. 

To optimize lentiviral delivery, experiments using a self-inactivating lentiviral vector (LV) expressing enhanced GFP (eGFP) from an internal CMV promoter were performed. DCs cells were transduced at different multiplicity of infection. FACS analysis indicated a good transfection efficiency (up to 80%). Evaluation of the effect of lentiviral infection on DC phenotype/activation, revealed that LV infection per se neither modified DC phenotype/activation state nor significantly interfered with their capacity to mature upon appropriate stimulation. 

These approaches are currently being used to silence the transcription factor IRF4, and finely dissect its recently discovered function during human myeloid DC differentiation. 

They will also be applied to the selective silencing of ILT3 (see below), based on the working hypothesis that disrupting molecular pathways leading to tolerance may result in the generation of a DC more successful in stimulating the proper immune response against tumours. """ ;

We demonstrated using this syngeneic mouse tumor model that the inadequate nature of the antitumor CTL response is not due to direct Ag presentation by the tumor cells, but results from presentation of tumor-derived Ag by nonactivated CD11c(+) APC. Although this event results in division of naive CTL in tumor draining lymph nodes, it does not establish a productive immune response. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with dendritic cell-stimulating agonistic anti-CD40 mAb resulted in systemic efflux of CTL with robust effector function capable to eradicate established tumors. For efficacy of anti-CD40 treatment, CD40 ligation of host APC is required because adoptive transfer of CD40-proficient tumor-specific TCR transgenic CTL into CD40-deficient tumor-bearing mice did not lead to productive antitumor immunity after CD40 triggering in vivo. CpG and detoxified LPS (MPL) acted similarly as agonistic anti-CD40 mAb with respect to CD8(+) CTL efflux and tumor eradication. Together these results indicate that dendritic cells, depending on their activation state, orchestrate the outcome of CTL-mediated immunity against tumors, leading either to an ineffective immune response or potent antitumor immunity.""" ;

      dc:description "Melanoma antigen-encoding gene 3 (MAGE-3) is an ideal candidate for a tumor vaccine although its potency need to be increased. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) represents a potential approach for increasing the potency of DNA vaccines. In the present study, a fusion DNA vaccine composed of Mycobacterium tuberculosis HSP70 and MAGE-3 was constructed and used to immunize C57BL/6 mice against B16 or B16-MAGE-3 tumor cells. The results show that the HSP70-MAGE-3 fusion DNA vaccine enhanced the frequency of MAGE-3-specific cytotoxic T-cells as compared to the MAGE-3 DNA vaccine or the HSP70/MAGE-3 cocktail DNA vaccine (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the results indicate that the HSP70-MAGE-3 fusion DNA vaccine can strongly activate MAGE-3 specific cellular immunological reactions and thus significantly inhibit the growth of B16-MAGE-3 tumors, improving the survival of tumor-bearing mice, and the HSP70-MAGE-3 fusion DNA vaccine has a significant therapeutic effect on the tumors that express MAGE-3 antigens." ;

We studied TcR-Tg clones specific of each antigen (P14-GP33 specific, 0T-1-OVA specific), as well as endogenous polyclonal T cells, specific for the same antigens, identified by MHC pentamers loaded with specific peptides. In each individual T cell, we studied the expression of twenty different genes either mediating effector functions, or coding for different receptors involved in T cell differentiation and memory generation. We were surprised to observe that each type of infection induced peculiar expression of the effector molecules or receptors expressed by responding cells, thus generating unique divergent differentiation patterns.  Endogenous LCMV polyclonal T cells and P14 T cells showed the same differentiation patterns that were different from those of OT-1 T cells responding to Listeria-OVA. These results suggest that CD8 differentiation is dependent of the infectious context, rather than of the TCR specificity. 

Our present studies aim to confirm this notion.  For that purpose, we will challenge P14 LCMV-GP33 specific T cells with the Listeria-GP33, to identify if these cells now express a pattern of differentiation similar to OT-1 T cells responding to Listeria-OVA. Whatever the mechanisms, these results describe for the first time alternative pathways of CD8 differentiation, that have nothing in common with those of CD4 T cells, since divergent gene expression does not mimic at all Th1 and TH2 differentiation.""" ;

Lymphoid tissue plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells (DCs) are continuously regenerated from hematopoietic stem cells. The cytokine dependence and biology of plasmacytoid and conventional DCs suggest that regeneration might proceed through common DC-restricted developmental intermediates. By selecting for cytokine receptor expression relevant to DC development, we were able to identify highly cycling Lin–c-KitintFlt3+M-CSFR+ cells with a distinct gene-expression profile in mouse bone marrow that, on a clonal level in vitro and as a population both in vitro and in vivo, efficiently generated plasmacytoid and conventional DCs but no other lineages, which increased in number after in vivo injection of the cytokine Flt3 ligand. These clonogenic common DC progenitors (CDP) thus define a cytokine-regulated DC developmental pathway that ensures the supply of various DC populations in vivo.""" ;

      dc:description "BACKGROUNDAnimal experiments have suggested that a high intraperitoneal pressure (IPP) might adversely affect the surgical peritoneal environment. The present experimental study investigates the impact of IPP of a CO(2) pneumoperitoneum on human peritoneum.METHODSPatients undergoing laparoscopic surgery were subjected to either low (8 mmHg) or standard (12 mmHg) IPP. Normal peritoneum was collected from the parietal wall at the beginning of surgery and every 60 min thereafter. Expression levels of 168 genes that encode extracellular matrix proteins, adhesion molecules or inflammatory cytokine signaling molecules were measured in peritoneal tissues using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay panels. Human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) and human peritoneal fibroblasts (HPFBs) were incubated in a CO(2) insufflation chamber for 1 h at 12 or 8 mmHg. Hyaluronan (HA) synthesis and mRNA expression levels of hyaluronic acid synthases (HAS) and hyaluronidases (Hyal) in HPMCs and HPFBs were measured at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h after CO(2) gas exposure by ELISA and real-time PCR, respectively.RESULTSExpression levels of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), matrix metalloproteinase-9, E-selectin, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 (CXCL-2), Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 were significantly higher and those of HAS-1, HAS-3, thrombospondin-2 (TSP-2) and interleukin-10 were significantly lower in the 12 mmHg group compared with the 8 mmHg group. HA synthesis was significantly lower in the 12 mmHg group compared with the 8 mmHg group in HPMCs and HPFBs throughout the time course.CONCLUSIONSA low IPP (8 mmHg) may be better than the standard IPP (12 mmHg) to minimize the adverse impact on the surgical peritoneal environment during a CO(2) pneumoperitoneum." ;

Mouse studies unraveled the bioactivity of Dex onto NK cells, Dex promoting a IL-15Ra-dependent NK cell proliferation and a NKG2D-dependent activation resulting in an anti-metastatic effect. In humans, Dex bear functional IL-15R? which allow proliferation and IFNg secretion by NK cells. In contrast to immature DC, human Dex harbor NKG2D ligands on their surface leading to a direct engagement of NKG2D and NK cell activation ex vivo. In our phase I clinical trial, we highlight the capacity of Dex based-vaccines to restore the number and NKG2D-dependent function of NK cells." ;

We have concentrated on the evaluation of the interplay between the hematopoetic factor Flt3L and IFNalpha,beta and have data available from our studies. We found that the cooperation between IFNalpha,beta and Flt3L (FL) plays an important role in the defense against Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in neonates. Treatment of neonatal mice with recombinant IFNalpha has a short-term, FL-independent and a long-term, FL-dependent protective effect against HSV-1. In mice lacking FL, neonatal resistance against HSV-1 is very low and DC numbers in the spleen are reduced. The treatment of these mice with rIFNalpha at day 6 resulted in an increased resistance against infection with HSV-1 at day 7. In C57BL/6 mice, treatment with rIFNalpha at birth induced both FL and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) that resulted in enhanced resistance against HSV-1 at day 7. In contrast, in mice lacking FL, IFNalpha treatment at birth did not influence splenic cell composition and had no effect on viral protection. The transfer of pDC to mice lacking FL enhanced viral resistance. Therefore, the induction and function of pDC, normally controlled by IFNalpha,beta and FL, are decisive for viral resistance in neonatal mice." ;

Therefore, therapeutic vaccines such as DEX aimed at boosting tumor-primed effector T cells could benefit procedures that minimize the effects of Treg.""" ;

Using pharmacological inhibitors, or macrophages and DC from mice carrying a null mutation in MAP kinase signalling molecule(s), we have evidence for a role of certain MAP kinases in the regulation of IL-10 and IL-12, IFN-gamma production. The work on the role of the MAP kinases, TPL-2 and ERK in upregulation of IL-10 production and negative regulation of IL-12 and IFN-gamma induction, has been under review with the Journal of Experimental Medicine and is now about to be resubmitted – this has taken longer than expected due to breeding problems with mice and the requirement to make new retroviral transcription factor constructs as requested by the reviewers (Kaiser, Cooke, Rajsbaum, Wu, Papoutsopoulou, Ley,and O’Garra). 

This work forms the basis of the microarray analysis of macrophages and DC from different genetic backgrounds of mice, stimulated with CpG, in the presence or absence of a MEK inhibitor, to identify downstream transcription factors responsible for the regulation of IL-10, IL-12 and IFN-gamma in collaboration with P. Ricciardi Castagnoli. Additional findings on the dominant role of the MAP kinase p38 in TLR ligand induced production of IL-10 were published (Kaiser. Wu, O’Garra et al; and one collaborative paper has been published (Papoutsopoulou et al., 2006). 

Furthermore, R. Rajsbaum has published a manuscript in the European Journal of Immunology, titled “Type-1 Interferon-dependent and independent expression of tripartite motif proteins in immune cells” by Ricardo Rajsbaum, Jonathan P. Stoye and Anne O’Garra. In this paper he has revealed that TRIM molecules can be grouped in clusters based on their patterns of mRNA expression in the different cell populations.  His main work shows that a group of TRIMs that share similar structural features, namely the COS-FN3 domains important in protein-protein interactions and localization to the microtubules, are preferentially expressed in the CD4+ T cell subsets, suggesting they may share a common function in these cells. On the other hand, a different cluster of TRIMs is constitutively expressed at high levels in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). Conversely, he found that a different group containing a large number of TRIM genes are induced in primary mouse macrophages, myeloid DC (mDC) and pDC upon influenza virus infection in a type-1 IFN dependent manner, suggesting an anti-viral function. However, stimulation of macrophages and mDC with LPS and double stranded RNA also led to type-1 IFN dependent up-regulation of these TRIM genes, demonstrating that their expression is not directly regulated by the virus, and that they may have broader functions in innate immune responses. A subgroup of the TRIMs induced in macrophages and DC by viruses in a type-I IFN dependent manner, mapped to mouse chromosome 7, which is syntenic to human chromosome 11, where TRIMs with known anti-viral activity are localised, suggesting that they may have co-evolved to combat viruses. The study highlights the importance of TRIM molecules as effectors of the innate immune response.

The analysis of this data resulted from R. Rajsbaum training on the Mugen Course run by Castagnoli, and forms the basis of analysis of the data obtained in the microarray study listed below which is a collaboration with Prof. Ricciardi-Castagnoli, which he and Xuemei Wu have been analysing in the last months. 

RNA was sent to Partner P. Ricciardi Castagnoli (UNIMIB) for microarray analysis of macrophages and DC from different genetic backgrounds of mice, stimulated with CpG, in the presence or absence of a MEK inhibitor, to identify downstream transcription factors responsible for the regulation of IL-10, IL-12 and IFN-??. (experiments performed by X. Wu & R.Rajsbaum are accomplished as part of those experiments). We have received the data and Ricardo Rajsbaum and Xuemei Wu are currently analysing.
My group is (Ricardo Rajsbaum and Xuemei Wu) is involved in the pathway analysis database initiative. Regarding the knowledge portal, the microarray data on our experiment will be submitted in the coming year and a manuscript will be submitted for publication in collaboration with Prof. Ricciardi Castagnoli. Information on protocols to generate DCs etc have been submitted by the student, Ricardo Rajsbaum and will be placed on the portal.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """We have developed structural, kinetic and functional data to study the binding of ligands to CD1 molecules and activation of CD1d restricted iNKT cells. The results of these studies have led to: 

i) The development of protocols to refold in vitro CD1 molecules, which were used for the generation of CD1 tetramers. Ability to generate CD1d tetramers has provided us with the opportunity of comparing a broad panel of CD1d binding compounds for their ability to stimulate iNKT cells. 

ii) Identification of a novel population of NKT cells, which does not express the canonical invariant Valpha24 / Vbeta11 TCR . 

iii) Crystal structures of CD1b molecules loaded with phosphatidylinositol, ganglioside GM2 and glucomonomycolate and more recently of human CD1d loaded with alpha-GalCer. 

iv) Crystal structures of canonical and non canonical NKT TCR.  

v) Demonstration that stimulation of iNKT cells in vivo with the synthetic CD1d ligand alpha-GalCer significantly enhances immune responses to protein and peptide based vaccines, due to rapid iNKT dependent DC maturation. 

vi) We have also described the impact of combining injection of protein vaccines with a combination of iNKT cell-agonist alpha-GalCer and MPL, a detoxified version of LPS that signals through TLR4. This combination treatment stimulates antigen-specific T and B cell responses that are greater than those elicited with alpha-GalCer or MPL alone. Over the next few months we intend to extend these results to a new class of NKT cell agonist, which we have recently described, which are like alpha galactosylceramide have non-glycosidic lipids.  

vii) Characterisation of Siglec-H as a novel endocytic receptor expressed on murine plasmacytoid dendritic cell precursors. Siglec-H functioned as an endocytic receptor and mediated efficient internalization of anti-Siglec-H Abs. By immunizing mice with ovalbumin-conjugated anti-Siglec-H Ab in the presence of CpG, we demonstrate generation of antigen-specific CD8 T cells in vivo. Targeting Siglec-H may therefore be a useful way of delivering antigens to pDCs for cross presentation.""" ;

Tumor growth is supported by tumor stroma, which is made by matrix and infiltrating cells, such as tumor associated macrophages (TAM) and tumor associated dendritic cells (TADC). We have recently reported that TAM display massive nuclear localization of the p50 NF-kB inhibitory homodimer, which correlates with impaired inflammatory functions (Saccani et al., 2006).The functional significance of this observation was demonstrated in p50 NF-kB deficient mice, which displayed tumor growth inhibition. More recently, in order to evaluate whether this tolerogenic mechanisms may target other compartments of the immune system, we characterized the role of p50 NF-kB in dendritic cells (DC) functions, including their differentiation and maturation. Our new results demonstrate that p50 NF-kB plays a non redundant role in DC survival and APC functions. p50 NF-kB has proapoptotic functions in bone marrow derived DC, as its absence leads to a reduced rate of apoptosis/necrosis in DC activated for 48h with LPS. Moreover, after 48h of LPS stimulation, p50 -/- DC that are still alive (80% vs 40% of WT DC) display higher expression of MHC molecules and CCR7, as well as higher secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-18. This correlates with the enhanced capability of p50-/- DC to activate T cell responses, in vitro and in vivo.
Our data suggest that targeting p50 NF-kB activity may represent a strategy to enhance selective DC functions, with potential application in anti-tumor vaccination strategies.

Protocols of antitumor vaccination will be set to explore the therapeutic potential of p50-/- DC. Both approaches aim to provide additional significant advancements in these topics.""" ;

METHODS: An RNAi plasmid for survivin was transfected into SKOV3 cells, and the effect of shRNA targeting survivin on the expression of survivin was determined. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), flow cytometry, and TUNEL staining were used to assess apoptosis. The MTT assay was used to measure cell growth and changes in cisplatin sensitivity. SKOV3 cells were injected into nude mice, and the effect of shRNA targeting the survivin gene on tumor growth was assessed. RESULTS: SKOV3 cells transfected with an RNAi plasmid against survivin had increased apoptosis and slower growth. At the molecular level, these cells also had lower expression of survivin. Nude mice inoculated with SKOV3 cells developed cancers, and treatment with shRNA targeting survivin markedly inhibited the growth of these cancers with no obvious side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies of SKOV3 cells and ovarian cancer xenografts in nude mice indicate that shRNA targeting survivin has potential for the treatment of ovarian cancer." ;

We examined plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules in early pregnancy, to assess their ability to predict preeclampsia. METHODS:: In a prospective longitudinal study, 2600 women with singleton pregnancies and no history of hypertension were recruited at their antenatal hospital (booking) visit at gestational week 12-16. Of these, 49 (1.9%) developed preeclampsia, whereas 74 women matched for age and BMI with uncomplicated pregnancies were selected as controls. A subset of women with risk factors for preeclampsia were sampled again at gestational weeks 16 and 28 (11 cases, 39 controls) and postnatally (six cases, 36 controls). RESULTS:: From multiplex analysis, soluble E-selectin concentrations were higher at 12-16 weeks in women who subsequently developed preeclampsia (15.1 ± 4.9 versus 12.9 ± 4.5 ng/ml, P = 0.02). At gestational week 28, E-selectin concentrations were again higher in women who went on to develop preeclampsia compared with controls (14.4 ± 5.6 versus 10.7 ± 3.5 ng/ml, P = 0.010), whereas levels were not different between the two groups in postpartum samples. CONCLUSION:: Changes in soluble E-selectin concentration in early pregnancy may reflect underlying pathophysiological processes, potentially providing mechanistic insights into preeclampsia." ;

      dc:description "Enzymatic oxidation of commercially available pyrogallol was efficiently transformed to an oxidative product, purpurogallin. Purpurogallin plays an important role in inhibiting glutathione S-transferase, xanthine oxidase, catechol O-methyltransferase activities and is effective in the cell protection of several cell types. However, the anti-inflammatory functions of purpurogallin are not well studied. Here, we determined the effects of purpurogallin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated proinflammatory responses. The results showed that purpurogallin inhibited LPS-mediated barrier hyper-permeability, monocyte adhesion and migration and such inhibitory effects were significantly correlated with the inhibitory functions of purpurogallin on LPS-mediated cell adhesion molecules (vascular cell adhesion molecules, intracellular cell adhesion molecule, E-selectin).

Given these results, purpurogallin showed its anti-inflammatory activities and could be a candidate as a therapeutic agent for various systemic inflammatory diseases.

      rdfs:comment """We investigated the effects of tumour hypoxia on DC differentiation and maturation and gathered data in mice. 

This is a an important topic as sites of inflammation are often characterized by both low oxygen tension and an extensive infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes, including DC, which need to move against oxygen gradients. We showed that oxygen availability is necessary to promote full monocyte-derived DC differentiation and maturation. Low oxygen tension (hypoxia) inhibits expression of several differentiation and maturation markers (CD1a, CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86, and MHC class II molecules) in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as their stimulatory capacity for T-cell functions. These events are paralleled by impaired up-regulation of the chemokine receptor CCR7, an otherwise necessary event for the homing of mature DCs to lymph nodes. In contrast, hypoxia strongly up-regulates production of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly TNFalpha and IL-1beta, as well as the inflammatory chemokine receptor CCR5. Subcutaneous injection of hypoxic DCs into the footpads of mice results in defective DC homing to draining lymph nodes, but enhanced leukocyte recruitment at the site of injection. Thus, hypoxia uncouples the promotion of inflammatory and tissue repair from sentinel functions in DCs, which we suggest is a safeguard mechanism against immune reactivity to damaged tissues.

During the next period we wish to characterize the molecular basis of our observations. In particular, an effort will be made to investigate mechanisms underlying the enhanced inflammatory functions of differentiating DC in hypoxia.

Biochemical and functional studies will be focused on the role of the Hypoxia- Inducible Factor-1 and -2, (HIF-1 and HIF-2) as they represent putative mediators of the adaptive response of DC to hypoxia.""" ;

      dc:description "BACKGROUND: Proteins involved in the aberrant regulation of signaling pathways and their downstream effectors are promising targets for cancer therapy. Survivin is an anti-apoptotic and cell cycle-promoting protein, which is consistently overexpressed in cancer cells. In normal cells, its expression is tightly controlled by signaling pathways and their associated transcriptional activators and repressors. In cancer cells, its expression is enhanced as a consequence of oncogenic signaling. We investigated the potential of a novel, peptide-based survivin inhibitor in breast cancer (SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-468) and glioblastoma (Tu9648) cells. These cells express high levels of survivin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We downregulated survivin expression in tumor cells with a lentiviral gene transfer vector encoding a specific shRNA and a recombinant fusion protein, rSip, comprising the FTH1-derived survivin interaction domain, the human thioredoxin and a protein transduction domain. RESULTS: Downregulation of survivin expression decreased the growth and viability of tumor cells in culture and reduced growth of the cancer cells upon transplantation into immunodeficient mice. rSip selectively targets the anti-apoptotic function of survivin and causes tumor cell death. Non-transformed NIH/3T3 and MCF10A cells remain unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: rSip provides a lead structure for the development of drugs targeting the tumor cell \"addiction protein\" survivin." ;

We have shown that R-848 causes massive changes in DC migration and leads to their activation in lymph nodes but not lymph. These changes are due to TNF-alpha (migration) and Type 1 interferons (activation), but are not accompanied by obvious oral adjuvant effects. In contrast Etx causes only minor changes in migration and activation but is a potent oral adjuvant. Current work is centering on understanding the cellular and molecular bases of these differences and examining other TLR7/8 ligands." ;

      dc:description "Aim:Gefitinib is effective in only approximately 20% of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. FoxM1 is upregulated in NSCLC and associated with a poor prognosis in NSCLC patients. In this study, we examined the possible role of FoxM1 in gefitinib resistance and the related mechanisms.Methods:Gefitinib resistant human lung adenocarcinoma cell line SPC-A-1 and gefitinib-sensitive human lung mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line NCI-H292 were used. mRNA and protein expression of FoxM1 and other factors were tested with quantitative RT PCR and Western blot analysis. RNA interference was performed to suppress FoxM1 expression in SPC-A-1 cells, and lentiviral infection was used to overexpress FoxM1 in H292 cells. MTT assay and flow cytometry were used to examine the proliferation and apoptosis of the cells.Results:Treatment of SPC-A-1 cells with gefitinib (1 and 10 μmol/L) upregulated the expression of FoxM1 in time- and concentration-dependent manners, while gefitinib (1 μmol/L) downregulated in H292 cells. In SPC-A-1 cells treated with gefitinib (1 μmol/L), the expression of several downstream targets of FoxM1, including survivin, cyclin B1, SKP2, PLK1, Aurora B kinase and CDC25B, were significantly upregulated. Overexpression of FoxM1 increased the resistance in H292 cells, while attenuated FoxM1 expression restored the sensitivity to gefitinib in SPC-A-1 cells by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis.Conclusion:The results suggest that FoxM1 plays an important role in the resistance of NSCLC cells to gefitinib in vitro. FoxM1 could be used as a therapeutic target to overcome the resistance to gefitinib." ;

In these studies we used as Ag either Ovalbumin, or rec. Prion-protein. In the latter system, a CD4 T cell response could be initiated. We also found that the DNA sugar backbone determines TLR9 activation. We found that abasic PD 2’ deoxyribose homopolymers act as weak TLR9 agonist and that DNA bases short of CpG-motifs enhance this agonist activity. In contrast phospho-thioate (PS) modified abasic 2’ deoxyribose homopolymers act as TLR9 (and TLR7) agonists, but CpG-motifs convert the antagonistic function into agonist-activity. 

Interestingly, T cell immunity induced was preventive and therapeutic in infectious and tumor models. Since PLGA-MS have a safety history in man, these preclinical vaccination data are promising for use in human.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """Research and Development at Hadassah Medical Organization

In General, the assumption that a physician can keep abreast of the latest developments and scientific knowledge solely by reading the professional literature is unfounded. Although the professional literature is widely available, cutting-edge medicine practiced at a high level of distinction is found only where physicians are involved in vibrant and active research. 

The Hadassah Medical Organization’s perspective embraces a broad view of the needs of the country and the field of medicine. Holding a deep conviction that research is the essence of medicine, Hadassah is committed to advancing and developing the field of medicine in Israel by translating research insights into practical advances that not only prolong but enhance the quality of life. In light of this, Hadassah has set excellence in research as one of the highest of its goals and made research activity its norm. Hadassah is committed to encouraging its physicians to participate in research and to incorporate them into both the Israeli and the international world of research.

Research at Hadassah 

Research at Hadassah hospitals touches every field and area of medicine, be it basic, clinical or applied research. Every department, unit and clinical institute at Hadassah includes a research arm with state-of-the-art laboratories available for the researchers’ use. In addition to those academic researchers at Hadassah for whom research is their main focus, we would like to see every Hadassah physician active in research. A substantial proportion of research at Hadassah is done in cooperation with researchers from the Hebrew University, as well as with researchers from other research institutes in Israel and worldwide. Thus, Hadassah is particularly devoted to openness to interdisciplinary research not only within its schools and departments, but also within its laboratories, institutes and research centers in Israel and abroad. 

Hadassah’s research labs are an inseparable part of the hospital’s clinical departments. In addition, research also takes place in designated research units and in multi-disciplinary research centers, such as the Women’s Health Center, the Gene Therapy Center, the Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, Cancer Immunotherapy and Cell Therapy, the Bone Calcium and Metabolism Research Center, and others. The Ministry of Science recognizes the Gene Therapy Center and Embryonic Stem Cell Center at Hadassah as foundational national centers. These research centers are providing information, help and service to the entire research community in Israel (information on these centers is found in the second chapter of this book).  

In addition to the departmental labs and the multi-disciplinary research centers, our researchers have at their disposal unique basic laboratories, including the cGMP-grade Vector Production Lab; laboratories that meet P3 standards; the Transgenetic Mice Production Unit; the SPF-grade Animal Lab; an Animal MRI Lab, and more.

Hadassah is establishing cooperative centers for the prevention, treatment and research of specific diseases, such as the Diabetes Center, the Lupus Center, the IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) Center, the Cardiovascular Disease Research Center, and others (information on these centers is found in Chapter 3 of this book, under “Information on Various Departments”). These centers, as well, take part in clinical and basic research, each in its own field. 

Funding of research at Hadassah is provided via both internal and external sources. The Hadassah Women’s Zionist Organization of America (HWZOA) has made commitment to research its watchword, and invests heavily in this area. Despite the current financial situation and the deep recession in Israel and worldwide, this year, as well as during the past two previous years, HWZOA have succeeded in continuing to raise funds to finance research. Every year, HWZOA directly distribute Hadassah research funding in the amount of approximately one million dollars – in addition to HWZOA investments in research infrastructure and human resources. Internal research funds are awarded on a competitive basis, with the aim of attracting external competitive funding from Israeli and international sources. In the realm of competitive research, a wide campaign of clinical and applied research is taking place, funded by commercial pharmaceutical and medical equipment companies. A substantial portion of this research originates in the developments that came out of research done at Hadassah.

The high quality of research done at Hadassah can be seen in, among other things, the relatively large number of grants received each year by competitive sources in Israel and worldwide, such as the USA National Institutes of Health, the bi-national funds of Germany, France and USA, the European Union funds, and private funds and organizations.   

Likewise, research excellence is also evidenced in the relatively large number of scientific publications published each year by Hadassah researchers in the leading scientific literature. 

Hadasit Ltd. was founded with the purpose of establishing, supporting and advancing the commercialization of information gained through research done at Hadassah. In the past three years, Hadasit has established twelve technological development subsidiary companies, produced new devices and drugs, and applied for over forty patents created by Hadassah researchers.

Over 200 clinical trials performed each year at the two Hadassah hospitals are facilitated by the Hadasit Company. These clinical trials are part of a series of tests required in the process of authorizing drugs, equipment, methods, or new medical protocols for use in humans. The trials are financed by commercial entities and are used as an important source of data for Evidenced-based Medicine and as a tool for the inculcation of Good Clinical Practices.  (Information on Hadasit can be found in this chapter).

The first chapter of this book presents a selected number of articles and research on various topics, all performed at Hadassah. The second chapter introduces the multi-disciplinary research centers and the national infrastructure found at Hadassah. Finally, the third chapter presents the researchers and a list of their publications in the past three years. The material in this book is organized according to Hadassah divisions and departments. At the end of the book are an index of research topics and an index of researchers. 

The Hadassah Medical Organization’s Division of Research and Development is at your disposal regarding all questions and matters pertaining to researchers and research at Hadassah.""" ;

Transmission of shear forces to platelet receptors such as GPIbα, P-selectin, α(2)β(1), and α(2b)β(3) controls adhesion dynamics. These forces also drive membrane tether formation, cellular deformation, and mechanosignaling in blood cells. Blood flow results in red blood cell (RBC) drift towards the center of the vessel along with a near-wall plasma layer enriched with platelets. RBC motions also dramatically enhance platelet dispersion. Trajectories of individual platelets near a thrombotic deposit dictate capture-activation-arrest dynamics as these newly arriving platelets are exposed to chemical gradients of ADP, thromboxane, and thrombin within a micron-scale boundary layer formed around the deposit. If shear forces are sufficiently elevated (>50 dyne/cm(2)), the largest polymers of von Willebrand Factor may elongate with concomitant shear-induced platelet activation. Finally, thrombin generation enhances platelet recruitment and clot strength via fibrin polymerization. By combination of coarse-graining, continuum, and stochastic algorithms, the numerical simulation of the growth rate, composition, and occlusive/embolic potential of a thrombus now spans multiscale phenomena. These simulations accommodate particular flow geometries, blood phenotype, pharmacological regimen, and reactive surfaces to help predict disease risk or response to therapy." ;

Using a soluble iNKT TCR and a newly engineered antibody specific for alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer)-human CD1d (hCD1d) complexes, we measured the affinity of binding of iNKT TCR to hCD1d molecules loaded with a panel of alpha-GalCer analogues and assessed the rate of dissociation of alpha-GalCer and alpha-GalCer analogues from hCD1d molecules.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are an attractive tool for immunomodulation, targeting mature DCs (mDCs) for immunization or immature/semimature DCs (iDCs) for tolerization. Therefore, introducing antigens into DCs has become a prime topic in various immunological disciplines. Numerous studies have shown that lentiviruses are an efficient vehicle for this purpose. 

This study evaluates the effects of lentiviral transduction on iDC activation. Immature DCs are efficiently transduced with increasing doses of lentivirus without affecting cell viability. Transduction at low multiplicities of infection (MOIs) did not result in phenotypical or functional maturation. Higher doses of lentivirus, however, resulted in upregulation of adhesion, costimulatory, and HLA molecules, as well as in increased allostimulatory capacity and secretion of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Production of IL-12 p70, IL-10, and interferon-alpha was observed only at extremely high doses. Protein kinase R phosphorylation on transduction at an MOI of 150 was demonstrated by Western blotting. A Toll-like receptor (TLR)-driven luciferase reporter assay showed dose-dependent activation of TLR2, TLR3, and TLR8, which was independent of the pseudotype, production, or transduction protocol and was abrogated on heat inactivation. These data show that lentiviral vectors provide not only the antigen but also appropriate activation signals to iDCs, favoring their use for immunotherapy and vaccine development.""" ;

With around 75 interdisciplinary and practice-orientated courses of study, Leibniz Universität Hannover provides degree and continuing education courses which are orientated both towards demand and quality.

For graduates today, in addition to the academic qualification, it is absolutely essential to think in terms of interdisciplinary, networked systems. The large choice of subjects at Leibniz Universität Hannover permits students to shape their studies individually through a large number of possible combinations.

With the establishment of new courses of study, such as Mechatronics, Nanotechnology, Computer-aided Engineering, Plant Biotechnology or Industrial Engineering, Leibniz Universität Hannover has reacted to the changing demands of the employment market and offers a range of subjects rarely found in Germany.

As far as research is concerned, the University has a marked profile and a series of interdisciplinary focal points. Collaborative research centres, research groups and cooperation programmes with other institutions of higher education and research institutions are proof of this.
The availability of the appropriate specialist literature is also decisive for the quality of teaching and research: with its Technical Library, Hannover has the German Central Library for all fields of technology and their basic sciences, especially Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics and Physics. It is one of the largest specialist libraries in the world for these subjects. The Centre for Applied Linguistics and Special Languages, the Lower Saxony Computer Centre, the Service Center and the Career Service are further facilities which help and support research and study.

Science and industry are also working hand-in-hand. Since 2002 the research centre L3S has been working as a competence centre for innovative learning technology. In the Production Technology Centre at Hannover-Garbsen six institutes of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and well-known industrial partners are carrying out research into demanding production technology. In close cooperation with the Hannover Laser Centre and the Institute of Gravitation Physics at Leibniz Universität Hannover, the Max Planck Society has set up a section as an international centre for gravitational astronomy in order to carry out research into the “big bang”.

Leibniz Universität Hannover: an efficient and modern institution of higher education. Its declared aim is constantly to improve the quality of teaching and research so as to ensure that studying, teaching and researching in Hannover continue to be enjoyable.""" ;

Human CD83 is a marker molecule for mature dendritic cells (DC) and is also expressed on activated B and T cells. Although CD83 has been implicated in immune responses, its function on DC and T cells remains unclear. 

In this study, we wanted to assess the role of CD83 expressed on DC and T cells in the immune response. Down-regulation of CD83 expression on human DC through RNA interference (RNAi) results in a less potent induction of allogeneic T cell proliferation, reduced IFN-gamma secretion by established T cells and decreased capacity in the priming of functional tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes. In addition, CD83 mRNA-electroporated DC are stronger T cell stimulators. However, CD83 overexpression on Melan-A/MART-1-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) circumvents the need for CD83 expression on DC. Co-culture of immature DC with TIL or K562 cells overexpressing CD83 results in the production of enhanced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas this production is less pronounced or even absent in co-cultures with non-modified TIL or K562 cells. 
In conclusion, we demonstrate that CD83 expression on T cells and DC modulates the immune response by activating DC and by delivering costimulatory signals for the stimulation of naive and memory T cells, respectively.""" ;

Founded in 1817 as a Latin-speaking State University by William I, King of the Netherlands, Ghent University is a relatively young university. After its independence in 1830, the Belgian State was in charge of the administration of Ghent University; French was the new official academic language. In 1930 Ghent University became the first Dutch-speaking university in Belgium. The Decree of 1991 assigned great autonomy to the university.

Over the years eminent scientists such as Joseph Plateau (physicist, considered as a pioneer in the development of motion pictures), Leo Baekeland (inventor of Bakelite) and Corneel Heymans (Nobel Prize winner in Medicine) studied and worked at Ghent University.

With a view to cooperation in research and scientific service, numerous research groups, centres and institutes have been founded over the years. Several of them are renowned worldwide, in various scientific disciplines such as biotechnology, aquaculture, microelectronics, history,...

Today, after decades of uninterrupted growth, Ghent University is one of the leading institutions of higher education and research in the Low Countries. Ghent University is an open, committed and pluralistic university with a broad international perspective.

Located in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium and the cultural and economical heart of Europe, Ghent University is an active partner in national and international educational, scientific and industrial cooperation.

Ghent University's eleven faculties are composed of more than 130 departments all together. These departements offer high-quality courses in every one of their scientific disciplines, each inspired by innovative research.

- Faculty of Arts and Philosophy 
- Faculty of Law 
- Faculty of Sciences 
- Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences 
- Faculty of Engineering 
- Faculty of Economics and Business Administration 
- Faculty of Veterinary Medicine

The maturation state of dendritic cells (DCs) is an important determinant for the initiation and regulation of adaptive immune responses. In this study, we wanted to assess whether functional activation of human monocyte-derived DCs can be achieved by electroporation of an activation signal in the form of double-stranded (ds) RNA and whether simultaneous electroporation of the dsRNA with tumor antigen encoding mRNA can lead to the induction of a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response. Electroporation of immature DCs with poly(I:C(12)U), a dsRNA analogue, resulted in phenotypic as well as functional changes, indicative of DC maturation. Co-electroporation of DCs with both poly(I:C(12)U) and Melan-A/MART-1 encoding mRNA induced strong anti-Melan-A/MART-1 CD8(+) T-cell responses in vitro. Higher numbers of Melan-A/MART-1-specific CTLs were consistently obtained with poly(I:C(12)U)-activated DCs compared to DCs matured in the presence of an inflammatory cytokine cocktail. These results indicate that DC co-electroporation with both dsRNA and tumor antigen encoding mRNA induces fully activated and antigen-loaded DCs that promote antigen-specific CTL responses and may provide the basis for future immunotherapeutic strategies.""" ;

Tuberculosis, AIDS, hepatitis and malaria threaten the health of millions of people. 

At TWINCORE medical personnel and basic research scientists from various disciplines conduct infection research side by side. Our focus is upon translational research   the interface between basic research and clinical development. 
The goal is to enable the latest findings from basic research to lead to new therapies or diagnostic procedures for patients in the shortest of times. At the same time, basic researchers are looking for answers provided by the clinical work. A further key component of these bridges spanning research and practice is the approval procedures that we are required to complete for clinical applications. Our scientists at TWINCORE support the development of new strategies to combat infectious diseases by creating a scientific basis for risk assessment in advance of the clinical trials.

Around 70 scientists at TWINCORE are currently involved in addressing the following question: what occurs during the course of an infection and what can we do to counteract it? The unique aspect of our establishment is that medical experts, virologists, bacteriologists and immunologists join together in addressing pressing matters regarding infection research. TWINCORE incorporates four TWINCORE  groups and two translational research groups of the Hannover Medical School: 

- Institute for Experimental Infection Research
- Department for Experimental Virology
- Institute for Infection Immunology
- Department for Pathophysiology of Bacterial Biofilms 
- Cell and Gene Therapy Clinical Research Group 
- Infection and Cancer Clinical Research Group 

Our researchers analyse how pathogens and host cells interact with one another and which new mechanisms can inhibit this interaction. They are working on new vaccination strategies that train the immune system in a more specific manner than vaccination methods have been able to thus far. Moreover, in order to research severe illnesses such as hepatitis C our researchers are developing new preclinical model systems - from new cell culture systems to mice with an immune system similar to that of humans.""" ;

The scientific collaboration was extended in 2003 to Université catholique de Louvain (UCL) and to the Brussels branch of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (LICR). The developments are funded in part by the industry partners and by grants from the regional government of Brussels. 

These vaccines are making use of the unique properties of dendritic cells(DCs), a small subpopulation of white blood cells, to activate the sentinels of the immune system (T-lymphocytes). By loading artificially DCs with tumour associated antigens, it is possible to teach the immune system of the patient to destroy its own cancer cells.

The company is currently developing two types of DC vaccines which are both in Phase IIa clinical testing, namely:
DCs fused with whole tumour cells;
DCs loaded ex-vivo with proteins or peptides associated with tumour antigens.

The company also produces and markets a limited number of clinical grade cytokines for use in the preparation of cancer vaccines.""" ;

However, the available data concerning the description of effector and memory CD8+ subsets in humans remain rather fragmentary because different studies favored the usage of distinct and restricted sets of cell surface markers and functional parameters. 

We obtained coexpression data of 18 genes simultaneously in individual cells from CD8+ T cell subsets (associated to multiple markers to subdivide CD8+ T cells into 14 different cell types, several of which were not described previously). Our results show that each subset has a defined pattern of gene expression. Moreover, effector gene expression of CCR7- cells correlated only with CD27 expression levels and CD27/CD28 coexpression but not with CD45RA/R0 phenotypes. Our findings thus describe new CD8+ cell subsets, allow the identification of relatively homogeneous CD8+ subpopulations, provide a predictable and precise correlation between particular cell surface markers and CD8+ T-cell functional properties, and identify effector cells present in both CCR7-CD45RA+ and CCR7-CD45R0+ compartments. The results also indicate that activated cells might modulate the expression of CD45RA/R0 asynchronously rather than CCR7-CD45RA+ cells always issuing from CD45RA- precursors.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """At the end of the 17th century a monarch decided to survey a group of elderly people with the intent of discovering what they considered to be the change that had the most impact on their lives. What the great majority referred were not the wars or the sovereign changes they had witnessed but the introduction of a fireplace in their homes. The fireplace represented an innovation that allowed families to cook and heat their houses without being asphyxiated by the smoke.

More than political occurrences and sports events, people value their welfare, longevity and health. Practically all the changes that contribute to the improvement of our quality of life result from technological innovations that are a direct outcome of advancements obtained at the level of scientific knowledge. But, paradoxically, most people view science as something odd and quite distant from their daily lives - and nothing could be further from the truth! In fact, each new scientific discovery has the potential to invade and change our daily lives - from the food products we choose to the quality of healthcare services available to us. Naming just a few recent examples: satellite communications, cell phones and the Internet, genetically modified foods, genetic testing for hereditary diseases, and new treatments for AIDS and certain types of cancer.

Science and scientists are commonly viewed as belonging to a strange an impenetrable world. Because it is easy to be scared and terrified by something that one does not understand, it is increasingly important to bring scientists closer to society. Only a scientifically informed society can decide, in freedom, about the risks and benefits intrinsic to each innovation offered by scientific and technological progress.

Scientific research and technological development are costly activities. Progress and innovation lack great investments. Traditionally, it is up to governments to finance the pure pursuit of more knowledge, while the private sector primarily invests in projects targeted at developing new products that can be marketed and, therefore, be profitable. But tradition is not what it used to be and, for the sake of progress, the boundaries between fundamental research and applied research are fading away. Nowadays, all great advancements that take place in the majority of scientific areas depend on access to sophisticated technological platforms, in constant development, that derive from applied research projects. On the other hand, it is the knowledge acquired from fundamental research that supplies the necessary foundations for the birth of new applications.

One characteristic intrinsic to fundamental research is its unpredictability. In most cases, the great discoveries that revolutionised scientific knowledge and/or gave rise to important technological innovations, emerged from a research plan that did not, at the outset, foresee the results obtained. The great lesson to be taken from the history of science is that the pursuit of knowledge cannot be prearranged. Thus, it is crucial that investors are made to understand that what is truly important is to support good science and give thematic research freedom to teams of scientists who have proven their excellency and capacity for innovation. Naturally, this concept is extremely difficult to convey to governments and CEO'. For example, in 2000, the President of the United States announced the attribution of 50 million dollars to academic research in the field of prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This governmental decision was a direct result of the extensive media coverage given to the discovery of a potential vaccine against the disease by the researchers of a private company in San Francisco. It is easy to imagine the contempt of the President's advisors at the idea of using this money to study Portuguese Familial Polyneuropathy (a hereditary neurodegenerative disease that affects several families in the North of Portugal). However, it was in the process of studying this rare disease that the Portuguese researcher Maria João Saraiva discovered one of the basic concepts that inspired the experiments for the development of a vaccine against Alzheimer's disease. Quoting Lewis Thomas, \"If you want a bee to make honey, you do not issue protocols on solar navigation or carbohydrate chemistry, you put him together with other bees (and you'd better do this quickly for solitary bees do not stay alive) and you do what you can to arrange the general environment around the hive. If the air is right, the science will come out in its own season, like pure honey\".""" ;

      dc:description "Dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with tumor antigens have been emerging as a new strategy in cancer treatment. The MAGE genes are selectively expressed in a variety of cancer tissues such as melanoma or gastrointestinal carcinomas. However, no expression is observed in normal tissues except testis. There are several reports on clinical trials with these immunogenic peptides including MAGE gene-derived, which were shown to be effective for some patients with carcinomas. We previously reported a clinical trial treating gastrointestinal carcinoma patients with immature DC and MAGE peptides via intravenous injection. Autologous DCs were generated ex vivo and were pulsed with MAGE-3 peptide, depending on the patient's HLA haplotype (HLA-A02 or A24). In this study, patients were immunized with mature DCs pulsed with the MAGE-3 peptide four times every 2 weeks via s.c. injection close to the axilla and inguinal lymph nodes. Twenty-eight patients with advanced gastrointestinal carcinoma were treated and no toxic side effects were observed. Peptide-specific CTL responses, improvement in performance status, tumor marker decrease and minor tumor regressions after vaccination were observed in some patients. These results suggested that DC vaccination with the MAGE-3 peptide would be safe and can exhibit antitumor effects even in the patients with advanced gastrointestinal carcinoma who were previously treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy." ;

      rdfs:comment """With over 600 years of tradition, the Julius Maximilian University of Würzburg is today one of Germany's mid-sized universities. 400 professors in 10 faculties here teach roughly 20,000 students. 

The University of Würzburg is among the leading institutions of higher education in Germany; this has been confirmed by rankings carried out by national and international research organizations, international external assessment committees as well as by the German Federal and State Excellence Initiatives (founded in 2006). Internationally, the University of Würzburg is also one of the top-ranking academic institutions in many fields of research and study. 

As early as the early 1990s, the university had already begun establishing interdisciplinary research centers, in which new topics of research could be addressed and innovative courses of study created. These interdisciplinary centers have become the international trademark of the University of Würzburg. Numerous external assessment committees confirm this. 

Most recently, the university's priorities have been focused on theInternational Graduate School, established in 2004. The school's intention is to provide all doctoral students structured learning opportunities to accompany their first professional academic pursuits. The University of Würzburg is particularly devoted to supporting the next generation of young academics. 

The creation of new centers has acquired incredible momentum and has established Würzburg as one of the top institutions of higher learning in Germany. Currently, the nine Collaborative Research Centers and nine graduate research training groups are an indication of this momentum. The Collaborative Research Centers and graduate research training groups were established with grants from the German Research Institue (DFG). Underpinning the competitive nature of applying for DFG research grants, Axel Haase, President of the University of Würzburg, remarks: \"the chances of being awarded a DFG grant are generally around 20 percent.\" 

Today, the quality of the scientific research is measured by the number of research projects funded by goverment initiatives, private foundations, and industry. The number of publications in internationally-respected journals like Nature or Science is also a gauge of excellence in research. 

Although the number of professors, assistants, and instructors has remained constant over the past few years, the two parameters of success described above have increased at a nearly explosive rate since the mid-1990s. The foundation of this success was the establishment of new research centers and their integration into the larger structures of the university. """ ;

Dendritic cell biology :  Application to immune-therapy of cancer

Developed a decade ago on mesothelioma cancer, our work had shown that cell death and, in particular, the apoptotic process could initiate immunogenic properties if triggered in a context of cellular stress. Our more recent studies highlighted the induction of one such apoptosis with a favourable immunogenic context either by viral infection (attenuated vaccine of measles virus), or by methylation of DNA and/or the histone de-acethylation via their inhibitor treatments.     
We also showed, in vitro and in vivo, that dendritic cells, after phagocytosis of these apoptotic cells, could initiate an immune response with activation of a specific T  cell response (by presentation and cross-presentation of antigens).  
The aim of our investigation is to propose alternative therapeutics to conventional therapies of pleural mesothelioma, by initiating immunogenic properties of mesothelioma cancer cells after treatments such as :
1) induction of tumor associated antigen expression by specific epigenetic drugs including DNA methylation and histone de-acethylation inhibitors,
2) induction of immunogenic properties of cancer cells viro-infected (measles virus vaccine)
3) induction of an effective cytotoxic immune response via dendritic cells loaded with apoptotic tumor cells.""" ;

Pycnidione significantly inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with a 50% growth inhibition (GI(50)) value of approximately 9.3nM at 48h. Pycnidione significantly decreased the expression of cyclins D1 and E and induced G(1) phase cell cycle arrest and a subsequent increase in the sub-G(1) phase population. Pycnidione also markedly reduced the expression of survivin and activated caspase-8 and -3, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, caused the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and enhanced PAI-1 production, thus triggering apoptosis in the A549 cells. Taken together, pycnidione exerts anti-proliferative effects on human lung cancer cells through the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Therefore, testing of its effects in vivo is warranted to evaluate its potential as a therapeutic agent against lung cancer." ;

To prepare spores, cells are grown on YPD plates, replicated on SPOIV medium (2% potassium acetate, 0.25% yeast extract, 0,1% glucose) and sporulation is assessed by optical microscopy. Zymolyase (2 mg/ml) is used to digest ascum and liberate spores. [We initially performed experiments to evaluate zymoliase sensitivity of asci for this specific strain and we assessed that 15 minutes incubation was the minimum time needed to damage the ascus, without touching the spore cell wall.] Zymoliase is inactivated by heat (65°C for 2 minutes) and washed away carefully together with the remainings of the empty ascus, by resuspending twice the spore culture in 500 µl of distilled water centrifuging and discarding the supernatant; the spores are then resuspended to a concentration of 108 cells/ml. In order to exclude damage on the spore cell wall or effects on spore viability 100 µl of a culture of 1000 spores per ml is plated on YPD in triplicate. [The spores showed 100% viability.] The procedure used allows exposing DCs to the pure spore culture and to analyze the response to the spores alone, eliminating confounding effects of the presence of the ascus. Although from a mycological point of view the term ascospores might seem more appropriate than spores, we will use the term spores to specifically indicate that the effects we are observing are only due to the spores and not to the ascus. 
We observed that after 24 hours of culture in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO-BRL), spores were germinating and the exponentially growing cells were starting to divide. Therefore any analyses performed at later time points would be affected by this altered state, while no interference should be present until 24 hours. """ ;

However, it remains to be established whether LP can prime long-lived tumor-reactive CTL and whether other cell types are able to cross-present them. Using HLA-A2 healthy donor and melanoma patient-derived PBMC, we studied the in vitro cross-priming potential of Melan-A 16-40 LP bearing the HLA-A2-restricted epitope 26-35 or its analog 26-35(A27L) and compared it to the priming capacity of the short analog. We then addressed LP priming capacity in vivo using HLA-A2 mice. We also studied LP cross-presentation by monocyte-derived DC, plasmacytoid DC, monocytes, and B cells. We showed that the modified LP gave rise to high and sustained cross-presentation by monocyte-derived DC. This led to cross priming in vitro and in vivo and to expansion of long-lived tumor-reactive cytotoxic T cells. In contrast, the LP containing the natural 26-35 epitope primed specific T cells poorly, despite its long-lived cross-presentation, and T cells primed against the short analog were short-lived. We further showed that LP cross-presentation is restricted to monocytes and conventional DC. These results document for the first time, to our knowledge, the strong immunogenicity of a human tumor Ag LP. Of note, they underscore that this property is critically dependent on sufficient HLA binding affinity and/or TCR ligand potency of the cross-presented epitope. We conclude that LP fulfilling this requirement should be used as tumor vaccines, together with DC maturating agents, especially the Melan-A 16-40(A27L) LP, for the treatment of HLA-A2(+) melanoma patients." ;

The \"Bicocca\", as it is commonly known, is a university that strongly believes in the potential of its students and in combining their studies with an active social life.

The University of Milano - Bicocca has twenty-one departments for the scientific areas of Economics, Educational Sciences, Law, Mathematics, Physics and Natural Sciences, Medicine and surgery, Psychology, Sociology, Statistical Sciences.
The departments promote research at the University, and organise the research doctorate programmes.

HISTORY
The University of Milano—Bicocca turned 10 in 2008 but our history is richer than it seems. It was instituted on June 10th, 1998 to serve students from Northern Italy and take some pressure off the historical University of Milan which was getting over-crowded. At that time we did not have an officially nominated teaching staff. Groups of professors and researchers from the same scientific fields chose to come and participate in the project. They were driven by their enthusiasm for the new, and by the chance to broaden academic horizons without having their work undermined by traditional education methods. From the start, this very fertile climate became a unique training ground, which offered something new, even for the most traditional disciplines.

The University stands in an area on the northern outskirts of Milan that up until the late eighties was occupied by the Pirelli tyre industrial complex and is now the product of the biggest urban renewal project ever carried out in Milan since the end of the Second World War. Based on a design by the world-renowned ‘Gregotti Associati International’ design and architectural firm,  the ex industrial area and its warehouses were quickly converted into a new district, which includes our Athenaeum, research laboratories and student residence halls, the Arcimboldi Theatre,  temporary location of the La Scala theatre during its renewal tenure, the state National Research Council (CNR), multinational company offices and the new headquarters of the Pirelli Group, new homes and sports centres, showrooms, a large multi-screen cinema, and a park with the ‘Collina dei ciliegi’ (cherry-tree hill). 

In this cityscape the University of Milano—Bicocca was born and hundreds of lecturers have brought their competences, international networks and research groups. This synergy makes the University a laboratory where tradition and modernity are fused to invent an innovative visionary future. 

But why Bicocca?  The new quarter is named after the ancient villa Bicocca degli Arcimboldi (located at # 202, viale Sarca),  a mid-15th century rural residence of the Arcimboldi family, which now belongs to a financial holding company. In the heart of the Bicocca quarter, University buildings are characterized by red walls and white window shutters: the main complex facing the squares Piazza dell’Ateneo Nuovo and Piazza della Scienza is made of two pre-existing Pirelli warehouses.""" ;

Our university offers a wide spectrum of subjects, the diversity and interdisciplinary integration of which is unique in Germany. We see this \"integrated diversity\" as the key feature that enables us to enhance our profile in research and teaching while at the same time promoting the process of internationalisation more intensively. 

In addition to giving guidance in the pursuit of academic study, excellence in academic teaching requires us to develop new and innovative courses of study with an international orientation which will qualify our students to face the professional challenges of the future. Our career-focussed orientation is based on close co-operation with influential partners in industry, finance and politics providing a network of steadfast support through international exchange and individual contributions. A further priority in this respect is our commitment to maintaining ties with our alumni. 

Today, new knowledge is increasingly the result of interdisciplinary research which is no longer neatly compartmentalised within the traditional limits of academic subjects. Thanks to the breadth of our subject range, our university offers an ideal environment in which to generate this type of innovative research. This has enabled the university to secure a leading place among the German universities in the German Research Foundation (DFG) rankings and to attract a large number of Humboldt scholars, who have chosen our university as the place to pursue their research. We are committed to the constant improvement of our infrastructure, our study and research conditions and our service-oriented administration, all of which are essential as the university forges ahead on its way to becoming a first-class university of international renown.""" ;

Our pipeline of cancer product candidates is built on first-in-class oncolytic virus technology that replicates and spreads within solid tumors, causing the death of cancer cells, accompanied by the induction of a systemic immune response. We believe that this technology, \"OncoVEX\", is more effective than earlier-generation oncolytic viruses and has the potential to establish a new standard of care in the treatment of solid tumors, while minimizing side effects. 

OncoVEXGM-CSF is completing a 50-patient Phase II clinical trial in the United States for the treatment of unresectable metastatic melanoma, as a monotherapy, in the second line/salvage therapy setting. Data so far indicates that OncoVEX can destroy both injected and un-injected melanoma deposits. Pivotal studies, intended for registration, are currently being planned. 

Additional studies with OncoVEXGM-CSF are ongoing in head & neck cancer and pancreatic cancer. 

Our lead infectious disease product candidate is ImmunoVEXHSV2 , a vaccine for genital herpes. At least 45 million people over the age of 11 in the United States have been infected with HSV-2, the cause of genital herpes. However, even though a number of HSV-2 vaccine candidates have previously been developed, none has proved broadly effective. ImmunoVEXHSV2 is a novel live-attenuated vaccine candidate that expresses approximately 80 HSV-2 proteins intended to stimulate a broad and powerful immune response. In preclinical studies, ImmunoVEXHSV2 completely prevents disease and invokes a powerful immune response, indicating that ImmunoVEX HSV2 is more potent than other HSV-2 vaccines for which published data are available. We intend to initiate a Phase I clinical trial for this product early in 2008.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """A brief history of the University

As the oldest university in the English-speaking world, Oxford is a unique and historic institution. There is no clear date of foundation, but teaching existed at Oxford in some form in 1096 and developed rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris.

In 1188, the historian, Gerald of Wales, gave a public reading to the assembled Oxford dons and in 1190 the arrival of Emo of Friesland, the first known overseas student, set in motion the University's tradition of international scholarly links. By 1201, the University was headed by a magister scolarum Oxonie, on whom the title of Chancellor was conferred in 1214, and in 1231 the masters were recognized as a universitas or corporation.

In the 13th century, rioting between town and gown (townspeople and students) hastened the establishment of primitive halls of residence. These were succeeded by the first of Oxford's colleges, which began as medieval 'halls of residence' or endowed houses under the supervision of a Master. University, Balliol and Merton Colleges, which were established between 1249 and 1264, are the oldest.

Less than a century later, Oxford had achieved eminence above every other seat of learning, and won the praises of popes, kings and sages by virtue of its antiquity, curriculum, doctrine and privileges. In 1355, Edward III paid tribute to the University for its invaluable contribution to learning; he also commented on the services rendered to the state by distinguished Oxford graduates.

From its early days, Oxford was a centre for lively controversy, with scholars involved in religious and political disputes. John Wyclif, a 14th-century Master of Balliol, campaigned for a bible in the vernacular, against the wishes of the papacy. In 1530, Henry VIII forced the University to accept his divorce from Catherine of Aragon, and during the Reformation in the 16th century, the Anglican churchmen Cranmer, Latimer and Ridley were tried for heresy and burnt at the stake in Oxford.

The University was Royalist in the Civil War, and Charles I held a counter-Parliament in Convocation House, and in the late 17th century, the Oxford philosopher John Locke, suspected of treason, was forced to flee the country.

The 18th century, when Oxford was said to have forsaken port for politics, was also an era of scientific discovery and religious revival. Edmund Halley, Professor of Geometry, predicted the return of the comet that bears his name; John and Charles Wesley's prayer meetings laid the foundations of the Methodist Society.

The University assumed a leading role in the Victorian era, especially in religious controversy. From 1833 onwards The Oxford Movement sought to revitalise the Catholic aspects of the Anglican Church. One of its leaders, John Henry Newman, became a Roman Catholic in 1845 and was later made a Cardinal. In 1860 the new University Museum was the scene of a famous debate between Thomas Huxley, champion of evolution, and Bishop Wilberforce.

From 1878, academic halls were established for women and they were admitted to full membership of the University in 1920. Since 1974, all but one of Oxford's 38 colleges has changed their statutes to admit both men and women. St Hilda's remains the only women's college, though it will admit both women and men from October 2008.

During the 20th and early 21st centuries, Oxford added to its humanistic core a major new research capacity in the natural and applied sciences, including medicine. In so doing, it has enhanced and strengthened its traditional role as an international focus for learning and a forum for intellectual debate.""" ;

We describe two cases of patients with psychosocial disabilities and neglected NMSC. In conclusion physicians, who treat patients with psychosocial disabilities and NMSCs, should be aware of the risk of neglect and ensure that treatment is complied." ;

We have reported that plasmacytoid precursor dendritic cells (pDC) activated with the TLR-9 ligand CpG induce strong development of Th1 responses (Boonstra et al, 2003). In contrast, bone marrow-derived myeloid DC (BM-myeloid DC) and splenic CD8alpha+ and CD8alpha- DC, despite expression of TLR9 mRNA, were poor at directing Th1 responses when activated with CpG. 

We have determined mechanisms for DC-induced Th1 development and the molecular pathways for inducing Th1 cells producing IFN-gamma solely, or Th1 cells producing IFN-gamma and IL-10, which have important implications for regulation of the immune response to eradicate pathogens with minimum pathology. This manuscript is now submitted for publication (Saraiva, O’Garra et al, 2007 – under review for Immunity). We have already determined that GATA-3 remodels the IL-10 locus specifically in T cells (Shoemaker et al, 2006) but are now also showing that in the absence of GATA-3 other signalling pathways and transcription factors may lead to induction of IL-10.""" ;

The city of Brussels is the capital of a federal state which has three different administrative regions based on language and has been at the heart of Europe since 1957. It naturally follows that the city should have a university in keeping with its standing and the ULB, with its 20,000 students, 27% of whom come from abroad, and its very cosmopolitan body of staff, is an intrinsically international institution open to both Europe and to the whole world.

It was at the heart of the creation of a network of major universities from different European capitals – UNICA – and is involved in international programmes for research and development and for mobility.

The ULB is a multicultural institution which has 7 faculties and a range of schools and institutes and is, at the same time, a comprehensive university providing academic tuition in all disciplines and study cycles.

With its three Nobel Prize winners, a Fields medal, a Wolf Prize for physics, two Marie Curie Prizes and 29% of the Francqui prizes awarded, the university is also a major research centre which is recognised by the academic community the world over.

Nor does it shirk its social, societal and scientific commitments, which it meets through combining broad access to higher education with excellent quality research and through

its role in furthering economic development in the regions where it is located (Brussels and Wallonia). The ULB also has a teaching hospital – the Hôpital Erasme, a specialist institute for studying cancer – the Institut Bordet, and an extensive hospital network. 

For about a decade now the university has been actively involved in maximising research potential in both Brussels and Charleroi, where it has set up a biotechnology pole around its renowned Institute for Biology and Molecular Medicine (IBMM) and Institute of Medical Immunology( IMI)

In terms of partnerships, it is part of the Wallonia-Brussels Academy, together with the Mons-Hainaut University and the Mons Polytechnic Faculty and, in conjunction with 5 hautes écoles, the royal military school, 2 institutes for architectural studies and 2 colleges for fine arts, it also makes up the Brussels-Wallonia European University Pole.

As a private university, which is recognised and subsidised by the Belgian authorities, the ULB receives government funding today to the tune of 60% of its overall budget.

Founded on the principle of free-thinking analysis which advocates independent reasoning and the rejection of dogma in all its forms, the ULB has remained true to its original ideals – an institution free from any form of control which is committed to defending democratic humanist values, an approach it also extends to the way that it is run.""" ;

      dc:description "Cellular and molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) strategies for studying the spatiotemporal profile of neuroinflammatory processes after stroke are increasingly being explored since the first reports appeared about a decade ago. These strategies most often employ (super)paramagnetic contrast agents, such as (ultra)small particles of iron oxide and gadolinium chelates, for MRI-based detection of specific leukocyte populations or molecular inflammatory markers that are involved in the pathophysiology of stroke or plasticity. In this review we describe achievements, limitations and prospects in the field of cellular and molecular MRI of neuroinflammation in preclinical and clinical stroke. Several studies in rodent stroke models have demonstrated the application of MRI contrast agents for imaging of monocyte infiltration, which served as the foundation for pilot (small-scale proof-of-concept) cellular MRI studies in stroke patients. This may be achieved with isolated cells that are loaded with contrast agent through in vitro incubation prior to systemic administration. Alternatively, superparamagnetic iron oxide particles may be directly injected into the circulation to allow in vivo uptake by phagocytic cells. Both strategies have been successfully employed to measure the spatiotemporal profile of invasion of monocytes in and around cerebral ischemic lesions in experimental stroke models. Molecular MRI studies with target-specific contrast agents have shown the capability for in vivo detection of molecular markers after experimental stroke. For example, (super)paramagnetic micro- or nanoparticles that are functionalized with a ligand (e.g. an antibody) for specific cell adhesion molecules, such as E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), can target inflamed, activated endothelium, whose presence can subsequently be detected with MRI. Present applications remain limited as most of the currently available contrast agents provide relatively poor contrast enhancement, which is not easily discriminated from endogenous sources of tissue contrast. Nevertheless, current developments of more efficient particles, such as biocompatible liposomes, micelles and nanoemulsions that can contain high payloads of (super)paramagnetic material as well as other substances, such as dyes and drugs, may open a window of opportunities for promising translational multimodal imaging strategies that enable in vivo assessment of (neuroinflammatory) disease markers, therapeutic targets as well as drug delivery after stroke." ;

      rdfs:comment """Our lab has data available on the effect of endogenous IL-10 production by DC subsets resulting in low levels of IL-12p70 production in mice.

We have shown that plasmacytoid pDC respond to both CpG and the TLR-7 ligand R848 to produce very high levels of IL-12p70 (in the ng/ml range per 5 x 105 cells/ml) and IFN-gamma. However, BM-myeloid and splenic CD8alpha+ DC  produced at least fivefold less IL-12p70, and CD8alpha- DC produced undetectable levels of IL-12p70 upon stimulation with CpG. 

We show that induction of endogenous IL-10 production by these latter DC subsets accounts for their low levels of IL-12p70 production, and since the plasmacytoid pDC do not produce IL-10 this explains their production of high levels of IL-12p70.  Neither endogenous IL-10 production nor a lack of TLR9 expression can however explain the lack of IFN-alpha production by the myeloid and splenic CD8alpha+ and CD8alpha- DC. These data suggest that different pathogens may trigger differential cytokine production as a result of their engagement of distinct TLRs on DC, and in addition by their differential ability to induce IL-10 or IFN-alpha in different DC. This work has now been published in the J. Immunology (Boonstra, Rajsbaum et al, 2006) and the microarray studies as discussed above are based on this study but including the plasmacytoid DC and will continue this project in collaboration with P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli, UNIMIB.""" ;

Microbial invasions are perceived by pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-expressing cells of the innate immune system. PRRs bind a number of microbial products collectively referred to as microorganism-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the best-characterized PRRs. The interaction of MAMPs with TLRs expressed on dendritic cells (DCs) plays a particularly important role in regulation of immune responses. By interacting with different combinations of adapter proteins, individual TLRs turn on signal transduction pathways leading to the activation of different transcription factors, such as nuclear factor (NF)-kB, activation protein (AP)-1, and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs).

Levels of Her-2 expression was highest following transfection with  3 different truncated Transmembrane-extracellular constructs, in particular a Her-2 rat-human chimeric one, while a full-length mutant Her-2 construct resulted in relatively low expression. Transfection with the adeno-Her-2 construct resulted in a very high expression level (80% positive cells) of Her-2 in combination with high cell viability (90%),  which was in contrast to the relatively low expression observed with the same Her-2 construct as a pDNA construct transfected with the Amaxa based electroporation.

      dc:description "PURPOSE: An intact immune system likely contributes to the outcome of treatment, and may be important for clearance of drug-resistant tumor cells and for prevention of recurrence. While pharmacologic inhibition of BRAF(V600E) in melanoma patients, which is linked to immune suppression, results in an initial response rate, these responses are typically of limited duration. Combining immunotherapeutic drugs with kinase-targeted agents is an attractive strategy to increase clinical efficacy. Evidence suggesting that MAPK pathway activation in tumor cells contributes to immune suppression, suggests that the two approaches may be synergistic, provided that BRAF(V600E) inhibitors are nontoxic to immune cells. METHODS: To assess effects of mutant BRAF inhibition on systemic immunity, we studied 13 patients with tumors carrying a BRAF mutation who underwent treatment with GSK2118436, a V600 mutant BRAF-specific inhibitor. We performed peripheral blood immunomonitoring prior to and following one or two 28-day cycles of treatment. RESULTS: GSK2118436 treatment had no detectable impact on most immune parameters tested, including serum cytokine levels, peripheral blood cell counts, leukocyte subset frequencies, and memory CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell recall responses. A slight increase in serum TNF-alpha over the course of treatment was observed. In addition, three of the four HLA-A2-positive patients experienced a modest increase in circulating tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells following BRAF(V600) inhibitor therapy. CONCLUSIONS: GSK2118436 treatment results in no detectable negative impact on existing systemic immunity or the de novo generation of tumor-specific T-cells. These findings suggest that future trials combining specific BRAF(V600E) inhibition with immunotherapy should not impair immune response." ;

On the one hand we compared lipofection of tumor-antigen-encoding RNA to RNA electroporation into DC, and found that electroporation results in antigen expression in all cells, while lipofection results in higher antigen expression only in a portion of the cells (other cells are negative). Interestingly, the priming capacity of MelanA/HLA-A2-specific autologous CD8+ T cells by lipofected DC was higher compared to electroprated DC. On the other hand, we compared RNA electroporation to loading of DC with anti-DEC205-antigen constructs, consisting of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) directed against DEC-205, genetically linked to different parts of the MAGE-A3 model antigen (i.e. the KKl  and EVDPIGHLY peptides). To quantify presentation of the epitopes by DC, we used bulk T cells electroporated with TCR-encoding RNA in stimulation assays. Cytokine production by these T cells was used as a read-out.

      dc:description "Background:In uveal melanoma (UM), the most frequent primary intraocular tumour in adults, loss of one entire chromosome 3 (monosomy 3 (M3)) is observed in ∼50% of tumours and is significantly associated with metastatic disease. The strong association of metastatic disease with M3 offers the opportunity for molecular prognostic testing of UM patients.Methods:To re-evaluate M3 as prognostic marker in our clinical and laboratory setting and to determine the metastatic potential of rare tumours with partial M3, we performed a comprehensive study on 374 UM patients treated by enucleation in our clinic within 10 consecutive years, starting in 1998. Genotyping of all tumours was performed by microsatellite analysis.Results:Median follow-up time was 5.2 years. The disease-specific mortality rates (death by UM metastases) for tumours with disomy 3 (D3) and M3 were 13.2% and 75.1%, respectively. The disease-specific survival was worse when M3 was observed together with chromosome 8 alterations (P=0.020). Death of UM metastases was also observed in 12 patients (9%) with D3 tumours. The metastasising D3 tumours showed a larger basal tumour diameter (P=0.007), and were more frequently of mixed or epitheloid cell type (P<0.0001) than D3 tumours that did not metastasise. Mortality rate of tumours showing partial M3 (8.3%) was as low as that for tumours with D3.Conclusion:This shows that large tumours with disomy 3 have an increased risk to develop metastases. On the basis of these results, our clinic offers routine prognostic testing of UM patients by chromosome 3 typing." ;

This DERMA-ER-DC 05 trial (multipeptide loaded cytokine matured moDC + prior Treg elimination by 3x ONTAK treatment [5µg/kg], 8 evaluated pat.) did not show any enhanced immune reponses compared to the equivalent cohort in the DERMA-ER-DC 04 trial. 

Patient recruitment into the 2nd phase of the DERMA-ER-DC 06 trial has started (sequential adaptive design). Immunomonitoring of first patients showed efficient induction of broad immune responses.

However, we unexpectedly could not demonstrate any depletion of Tregs by ONTAK (ccoperation with P14). ONTAK treatment induced a transient depletion of all known DC subpopulations in the peripheral blood, a novel and very unexpected finding.

One possible reason for the discrepancies between our findings and published data  could be the amount of ONTAK used in patients. We therefore filed an amendment allowing the inclusion of additional 4 patients, who will receive higher doses (12microg/kg 3x and 18microg/kg 1x) before vaccination. Taking into account direct effects of ONTAK on DC, patients will be vaccinated some days after last ONTAK treatment (as soon as blood DC have recovered to 50% of pre ONTAK amount).""" ;

This work was performed by Christian A. Luber (PhD student). First, we have set up a system for SILAC labelling of bone marrow derived murine dendritic cells (BM-DC). The principal method for generating BM-DC with GM-CSF was adapted from Lutz et al. (J Immunol Methods 1999, 223: 77-92). After some modifications of the protocol the FACS analysis of DC, which were generated in conditions described by Lutz et al. or in modified SILAC conditions did not show differences in the expression levels of the common DC markers CD11c, CD80, CD86. Analysis by mass spectrometry showed successful labelling." ;

These deliver antigens to DC at very high efficiency and activate the transduced cells similarly to LPS. Based on this technology, Biovex began a clinical program where an HSV vector expressing full length tyrosinase, gp100 and MART-1 was used to transduce DC from melanoma patients which were then to be used for vaccination. Due to a change in emphasis, Biovex is no longer progressing this program but has, as a result, considerable internal expertise, reagents and methodology which could be of use to the project if partners would like to use HSV-based technology for the delivery of antigens to DC.

      dc:description "Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have displayed considerable promise for the treatment of cancer. However, their delivery to the desired cell population remains a challenging task. Here we have covalently conjugated a siRNA against survivin to gastrin-releasing peptides (GRP) to direct siRNA molecules to cancer cells that express the GRP receptor. The cellular uptake of the peptide-siRNA conjugates was tested in breast MDA-MB 231 cancer cells, which express the GRP receptor. Fluorescein-tagged GRP-siRNA conjugates were taken up by cancer cells, but not normal mammary epithelial cells or human blood monocytes. By 180 min of incubation, most of the cells have taken up the conjugates. Excess of free peptide inhibited uptake, implying dependence of uptake on GRP receptor. Moreover, bi-targeting of siRNA molecules by GR and luteinizing hormone-releasing peptides accelerated the uptake kinetics by MDA-MB 231 cells when compared to mono-targeted siRNAs. Peptide-siRNA conjugates, but not free siRNAs, inhibited the expression of survivin, an endogenous gene involved in cancer cell survival. None of the peptide-siRNA conjugates induced the expression of inflammatory cytokines or interferon α in human blood leukocytes. Overall, the data demonstrate the feasibility of GRP receptor-mediated targeted delivery of siRNAs to cancer cells, an important step for RNA interference therapy in humans." ;

The Phase 2 trial has the same general design, dosing regimen, endpoints, and immunomonitoring plan as the completed RCC trial. 
However, the Phase 2 study tests the improved RCC product (i.e., PME-CD40L DC) and is restricted to RCC patients with clear cell histology. 

As predicted from the in vitro data, the improved PME-CD40L DC product does indeed lead to restoration of both IL-2 and IFN-? responses. Also consistent with our in vitro observation is the gradual decline of the immune effector T cells in the peripheral circulation (i.e., weaker signal after the fifth dose). This is indicative of T cell effector memory maturation (i.e., CD8+/CD28+/CD45RA- T cells) which are equipped to leave the peripheral circulation and infiltrate the tissues in surveillance of target antigens. It is also noteworthy that presence of CD28+ T cells in tumor lymphocytic infiltrates correlates with favorable clinical outcome.

In contrast to the disease stabilization observed in our first RCC study, using the PME-CD40L DC product we have observed tumor regressions in a number of patients in the current study. At present, 6 of 12 patients that have been restaged using RECIST criteria have less tumor burden that when they enrolled in the study (15 weeks earlier). """ ;

YM155 selectively suppresses the expression of survivin and induces apoptosis in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism underlying these effects of YM155 is unknown. Here, we show that a transcription factor, interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3 (ILF3)/NF110, is a direct binding target of YM155. The enhanced survivin promoter activity by overexpression of ILF3/NF110 was attenuated by YM155 in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that ILF3/NF110 is the physiological target through which YM155 mediates survivin suppression. The results also show that the unique C-terminal region of ILF3/NF110 is important for promoting survivin expression and for high affinity binding to YM155." ;

      dc:description "BACKGROUND: Quite a number of strategies have been used to improve the efficacy of the DNA vaccine for the treatment of tumors. These strategies, ranging from activating CD4(+) T cell, manipulating antigen presentation, and/or processing to anti-angiogenesis, focus on one certain aspect in the functioning of the vaccine. Therefore, combination is necessary for rational DNA vaccines design by synergizing different regimens and overcoming the limitations of each strategy. METHODS: A DNA fragment (HSV) encoding the C terminal 37aa of human chorionic gonadotropin β chain (hCGβ), 5 different HLA-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes from human survivin and the 3rd and 4th extracellular domains of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) was inserted into the sequence between the luminal and transmembrane domain of human lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1) cDNA for the construction of a novel DNA vaccine. RESULTS: This novel vaccine, named p-L/HSV, has a potent antitumor effect on the LL/2 lung carcinoma model in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. The immunologic mechanism involved in the antitumor effect referred to the activation of both cellular and humoral immune response. In addition, the tumor vasculature was abrogated as observed by immunohistochemistry in p-L/HSV immunized mice. Furthermore, the mice received an additional boost with p-L/HSV 6 months later showed a strong immune recall response. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that the strategies of combining antitumor with antiangiogenesis and targeting the tumor antigen to the MHC II pathway cooperate well. Such a study may shed new light on designing vaccine for cancer in the future. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd." ;

      dc:description "PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to evaluate the role of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for symptomatic choroidal nevus with subretinal fluid (SRF) extending to the fovea. METHODS: Retrospective review of the medical records of all patients who underwent PDT for a symptomatic choroidal nevus with SRF. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were included in the study. The mean initial visual acuity was 20/80 (range, counting fingers to 20/20). The mean initial tumor thickness was 1.23 mm (range, 0.66-1.93 mm). All tumors presented at least 2 risk factors for growing (including orange pigment, symptoms, peripapillary location, SRF, and thickness >2 mm). The mean number of PDT sessions was 1.41 (range, 1-3). The mean final visual acuity improved to 20/60 (range, counting fingers to 20/20). Subretinal fluid was reduced in all eyes (100%) and had completely disappeared in 9 eyes (53%) after PDT. Of 9 cases with complete resolution of the SRF, 2 patients (22%) presented recurrence. The mean final tumor thickness increased to 1.24 mm (range, 0.66-2.01 mm) at a mean follow-up of 22.47 months (range, 6-60 months). Tumor thickness increased in 3 eyes (18%) and remained unchanged in 13 eyes (76%), and 1 lesion (6%) shrank down to a flat chorioretinal scar. CONCLUSION: Photodynamic therapy is a good treatment option to reduce SRF in symptomatic choroidal nevus with serous macular detachment. Further growth into melanoma was observed in 18% of cases. Thus, PDT may not allow a good local tumor control. Longer follow-up is required to determine its value in these patients." ;

However, among the 4 mAb, only 2C44 could stain DC in LACK-immunized mice, but not in OVA-immunized mice. Furthermore, 2C44 stained DC from LACK-immunized mice expressing the H2-d haplotype but did not stain DC from LACK-immunized mice of other haplotypes.

Group 1 received 300 microgram per peptide at a single site, group 2 received 100 microgram per peptide of the E6 peptides in one limb, and 300 microgram per peptide of the E7 peptides in a second limb. Group 3 received separate injections of E6 and E7 peptides, each at a dose of 50 micrograms per peptide. The primary endpoint was to determine safety and toxicity of the HPV16 long peptide vaccine. In addition, the vaccine-induced T-cell response was assessed by IFN gamma-ELISPOT. No toxicity beyond grade II was observed during and after 4 vaccinations. In a few patients transient flu-like symptoms were observed. ELISPOT analysis of the vaccine-induced immune response revealed that co-injection of the E6 and E7 peptides resulted in a strong and broad T-cell response dominated by immunity against E6. Injection of the E6 and E7 peptides at two different sites increased the E7-response but did not affect the magnitude of the E6-induced immune response." ;

      dc:description "Background:The availability of molecular-targeted therapies for the treatment of melanoma has emphasised the need to identify mutations in target genes such as BRAF and KIT. Circulating tumour cells (CTC) are present in the peripheral blood of a significant proportion of cancer patients.Methods:High molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMW-MAA) was used to isolate melanoma cells from peripheral blood as it is selectively expressed at high levels on melanomas. The HMW-MAA-positive cells were isolated using immunomagnetic beads. After removing CD45(+) cells, CTC were identified by staining with MART-1- and gp100-specific antibodies (HMW-MAA(+), CD45(-), MART-1/gp100(+)). Single, isolated CTC were then subjected to BRAF and KIT mutational analysis.Results:CTC (HMW-MAA(+), CD45(-), MART-1/gp100(+)) were isolated from the blood of 11 patients and BRAF and KIT were sequenced in nine and four patients, respectively. The BRAF sequences identified in the CTC were inconsistent with those identified in autologous melanoma tumours in three patients and the KIT sequences were inconsistent in three patients. In addition, polyclonal BRAF mutations were identified in one patient and concomitant mutations in BRAF and KIT were identified in another patient.Conclusion:Melanoma cells show clonal heterogeneity. Therefore, CTC genotyping may be crucial for successful molecular-targeted therapy." ;

The founders, Rotgans, professor of Surgery, De Bussy, publisher, and De Vries, professor of Pathology, wanted to create a cancer institute ‘where patients suffering from malignant growths could be treated adequately and where cancer and related diseases could be studied’. They bought a house on one of the canals in Amsterdam and named it the ‘Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Huis’, after the famous Dutch microscopist. The clinic had room for 17 patients, while the laboratory could accommodate 8 to 10 scientists.

Nowadays, The Netherlands Cancer Institute-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital (NKI-AVL) accommodates approximately 550 scientists and scientific support personnel, 53 medical specialists, 180 beds, an out-patients clinic that receives 24,000 new patients each year, 5 operating theaters and 9 irradiation units. It is the only dedicated cancer center in The Netherlands and maintains an important role as a national and international center of scientific and clinical expertise, development and training.

The three major areas of research are fundamental, clinical and translational cancer research. A thorough understanding of the biological processes of normal cells is the basis for understanding cancerous cells. The laboratory covers all major areas of cancer research, with special emphasis on cell-based screens, mouse tumor models, cell biology, structural biology and epidemiology. The institute coordinates and participates in many clinical trials; most of these are phase 1, 2 or 3 studies of potential new treatments such as combinations of chemotherapeutics, radiotherapy and/or surgery. Results obtained from fundamental research are translated into clinical applications as part of our translation research program.

From its first inception the NKI-AVL saw close collaboration between scientists and clinicians as essential to fighting cancer. Having a laboratory and hospital under one roof in a single independent organization with an open and collaborative atmosphere has led to many important discoveries and improved therapies""" ;

Our work (Lelouard et al., JCB) demonstrates that DCs down-regulate and change the quality of translation in order to increase their survival, however during this process MHC I antigen processing is affected. This has important consequences for the way antigens should be introduced in DCs and how long after stimulation they should be used during vaccination application.

We have also initiated studies on the impact of dsRNA on the regulation of translation and the functional response of DCs (IFN production). We have now demonstrated that DCs enters an “unfolded protein response-like state and controls the phosphorylation of a key translation initiation factor (eIF2-a).  The quality of the translation is not only affected, but the overall capacity of DCs to respond to stress is also modified in order to increase their survival and resistance to viral infection. This observation has important consequences on the use of different adjuvants during DC based vaccination trial. 

We are going to finalize the projects with several publications. We will follow-up our studies on the impact of dsRNA on the regulation of translation and focus on DCs in vivo and on the regulation of IFN production. """ ;

In addition, we have shown that the same DC can interact with Tregs and convert them into cells that co-express ROR?t and Foxp3 and produce IL-17. 
We have shown that this pathway can serve as an alternative to TLR signalling for allowing DC to become effector cells capable of priming CD4+ T cells. We have used agonists of the dectin-1/Syk pathway as adjuvants in vivo to induce DC activation and CD4+ T cell and antibody responses. We have shown that this operates in a dectin-1-dependent manner. We have also found induction of T-independent antibody responses via the same pathway. In addition, we have shown that tubulovesicular structures generated by cells overexpressing VSV-G act as adjuvants for inducing CD8+ and CD4+ T cell, as well as antibody responses in vivo. This is likely due to their DNA content and ability to trigger TLR9.

We will continue to use DC activation in vitro and, in particular, DC cytokine production as an assay to dissect innate pathways involved in DC activation. In parallel, we will continue to compare effector T cell instruction by DC activated via distinct innate receptors.""" ;

      dc:description "The objective of this study was to investigate the vascular status, left-ventricular mass and biomarkers of endothelial activation in hypertensive (HT) adolescents, with particular attention to comparing nonobese with obese patients. Seventy-nine newly diagnosed HT adolescents aged 15.1±2.1 years (divided into 34 nonobese and 45 obese) were compared with 35 healthy volunteers. Intima-media thickness (IMT), flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and left-ventricular mass index (LVMi) were determined using ultrasound. Adhesion molecules and inflammatory interleukins (ILs), together with lipids and insulin resistance (HOMA), were also studied. HT obese adolescents had higher triglycerides, HOMA, and elevated levels of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and soluble E-selectin compared with controls and nonobese HT patients. FMD was lower in HT groups (8.5±4.5% in nonobese, P=0.004; 8.1±4.9%, P=0.01 in obese vs 12.5±4.9%; in control), and IMT was higher (0.52±0.06 mm, P<0.001 in nonobese; 0.54±0.05 mm, P<0.001 in obese vs 0.42±0.05 mm in control). Higher LVMi was found in both HT groups, with the highest value in the nonobese group being 37.8±5.3 g m(-2.7) vs 28.4±5.3 g m(-2.7) in controls (P=0.003). In conclusion, nonobese HT adolescents had the same early cardiovascular deteriorations assessed ultrasonographically as their obese HT peers, although metabolic alterations and endothelial activation measured as plasma biomarkers were more pronounced in obese individuals. The potential mechanisms of early atherosclerosis in nonobese HT adolescents need further evaluation in prospective studies because these factors may differ considerably from those found in young obese individuals with HT.Journal of Human Hypertension advance online publication, 29 March 2012; doi:10.1038/jhh.2012.11." ;

METHODS:: This study included 32 locally advanced breast cancer patients. Tumoral expressions of survivin, TOP2A, and GSTP1 in serial biopsy specimens obtained before treatment, after sequential 4 cycles of doxorubicin+cyclophosphomide, and 4 cycles of docetaxel were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Survivin expressions were additionally analyzed in serial blood samples. RESULTS:: The pathologic complete response (pCR) rate and the overall response rate (clinical complete and partial) were 28% (n=9) and 91% (n=29), respectively. There were no statistically significant correlations between serial TOP2A expression levels and response. There was a nonsignificant trend toward an improved response rate with decreased survivin expression. A significant decrease in the GSTP1 expression level throughout treatment (P=0.014), which was also shown to be significantly correlated with a pCR (P=0.0001), was seen. Downregulation of GSTP1 after 4 cycles of anthracycline-based combination was independently associated with improved progression-free survival (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS:: Downregulation of GSTP1 is a significant predictor of pCR and improved progression-free survival during anthracycline-based and taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast cancer." ;

      rdfs:comment """Data has been obtained on the effect of exposure of DCs or gamma-delta T lymphocytes to HIV-1 and on the miR profile expressed in HIV-exposed DCs.

Based on our previous findings demonstrating a bidirectional activating interaction between immature MDDCs and gamma-delta T lymphocytes (Conti et al., JI. 2005), as well as on the demonstration that HIV-1 exposed MDDCs exhibit an impaired functional maturation (Fantuzzi et al., J Virol  2004), we are currently investigating whether exposure of DCs or gamma-delta T lymphocytes to HIV-1 can directly modulate their functions or interfere with their cross-talk.  Preliminary results indicated that, although virus exposure of gamma-delta T cells does not significantly affect their properties, HIV-exposed DCs exhibit a reduced capacity to deliver activation and proliferative signals to gamma-delta T lymphocytes. Moreover, a dysregulated pattern of cytokines and chemokines produced by both cell populations is observed in the presence of the virus.

Our preliminary results indicating that HIV-exposed MDDCs exhibit a reduced capacity to deliver activation and proliferative signals to gamma-delta T lymphocytes have been reproduced in a statistically significant number of donors during this year. In particular, we have observed that gamma-delta T cells co-coltured with virus-exposed DCs exhibit a reduced capacity to proliferate in response to phosphoantigens and to produce IFN-?. Reciprocally, HIV-1-exposed DCs co-coltured with activated gamma-delta T lymphocytes undergo phenotypic maturation but are impaired in IL-12 production. In contrast, direct exposure of lymphocytes to the virus does not significantly affect their properties. A preliminary analysis of the miR profile expressed in HIV-exposed DCs has also been carried out indicating that interaction of these cells with the virus rapidly induces the modulation of a number of miRs.

A further characterization of the effects of HIV-1 on the functional properties of both cell populations will be performed, and in particular it will be analyzed: 
(a) the capacity of virus-exposed DCs to recruit resting gamma-delta T cells; 
(b) the role of activated lymphocytes in controlling HIV-1 replication in DCs; 
(c) whether active virus replication in these cells is needed to achieve the above described effects; 
(d) the role of HIV-modulated miR in DC functions. """ ;

      rdfs:comment """Data were produced in our lab on a broad spectrum of priming events and their  impact on the effector and memory phases of the CTL response.

Activation of a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in an antigen-exposed lymph node involves a great diversity of encounters between naive CTLs and APCs that differ in both duration and quality. This broad spectrum of priming events instigates a complex blend of CTL developmental pathways. 

Using an experimental system that allows tight control over CTL priming, we have singled out defined priming events and analyzed the impact of the resulting instructional program on the effector and memory phases of the CTL response. As expected, prolonged antigenic stimulation induces potent CTL expansion, effector function and CTL memory. In contrast, CTL that have received suboptimal stimulation fail to undergo extensive expansion. Nevertheless these arrested CTL persist long term and acquire memory function in the absence of further cell division. Thus our data demonstrate that CTL memory can develop as a result of a suboptimal stimulation that causes arrested clonal expansion. 

The effect of environmental factors on development of high affinity CTL was investigated using a system whereby OT-1 cells were primed in vitro by engineered APC. After a 20 h priming phase, CTL were transferred to recipient mice that were either naïve, or had been injected with activated dendritic cells one day earlier, thus creating a reactive lymph node. Note that the reactive lymph node that is thus created does not harbour specific antigen. Using this system we are able to separate cognate antigenic and co-stimulatory signals that were uniformly delivered by the APC in vitro, from environmental factors such as growth factors, which are present in the reactive lymph node. Although primary responses were not affected by a reactive lymph node environment, responses to secondary antigenic challenge of CTL that had developed in a reactive lymph node were significantly enhanced. Experiments using CD40 and IL-12 knock out mice and IL-7R blocking antibody suggest that these factors do not play a role. IL-15 is a likely candidate molecule mediating the observed effect, but in the (genetic) absence of IL-15 memory cells do not survive and no secondary responses could be detected. """ ;

Using specific inhibitors we have previously found that src-family tyrosine kinases are required for cytokines and chemokines production during maturation of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) upon stimulation with several toll like receptor (TLR) agonists. We have now evaluated the role of Src kinases in DCs during synergic engagement of TLR8 with either TLR4 or TLR3. We tested if src-family tyrosine kinases inhibitors had any effect on the high levels of cytokine production induced in monocyte-derived DCs upon the synergistic stimulation of TLRs. Using the DNA microarray technology we have also analyzed which are the genes that require activation of Src kinases during TLR3 stimulation of monocyte-derived DCs. This pathway analysis will be of help in the elucidation of the molecular mechanism by which Src kinases regulate inflammatory cytokine production in DCs. """ ;

      rdfs:comment "Our group obtained data on molecular signaling triggered by LPS in dendritic cells and the role of CD14 in the regulation of the DC life cycle through NFAT activation. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the best-characterized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Individual TLRs recruit diverse combinations of adapter proteins, and thereby trigger signal transduction pathways leading to the activation of various transcription factors, including nuclear factor (NF)-kB, activation protein (AP)-1, and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is one of the molecules produced by mouse dendritic cells (DCs) after stimulation by TLR agonists. By analogy with the events following T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement leading to IL-2 production, it is therefore plausible that the stimulation of TLRs on DCs may lead to activation of the Ca2+/calcineurin and NFAT pathway. Our contribution to the project has been the finding that the DC stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces Src-family kinase and phospholipase C (PLC)?2 activation, influx of extracellular Ca2+ and calcineurin-dependent nuclear NFAT translocation. The initiation of this pathway is independent of TLR4 engagement, and dependent exclusively on CD14. We also show that LPS-induced NFAT activation via CD14 is necessary to cause death of terminally differentiated DCs (supplementary Fig. 1), an event that is essential for maintaining self-tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. Consequently, blocking this pathway in vivo causes prolonged DC survival and an increase in T cell priming capability. Our findings reveal novel aspects of the molecular signaling triggered by LPS in DCs and identify a new role for CD14: the regulation of the DC life cycle through NFAT activation. " ;

      rdfs:comment """Our data demonstrate that treatment of primed mice with intact anti-CTLA-4 antibodies induces the development of regulatory T cells expressing high levels of ICOS and producing IL-10. These regulatory T cells inhibit Th1 responses, in vitro and in vivo, and repress experimental intestinal inflammation, by a mechanism involving IL-10 and IDO. These ICOS+ regulatory T cells appear distinct from the naturally occurring regulatory T cells described above, suggesting that two populations can inhibit DC-induced Th1 responses in vivo.  Experiments are under way to identify the respective role and the synergy of IL-10 and IDO in the down-regulation of inflammatory responses in vivo. We have demonstrated the major role of IL-10 and indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase. We are presently trying to identify the cells expressing IDO (dendritic cells or epithelial cells?), using chimeras (WT/IDO KO) and purification of various cell populations from the lamina propria from control versus treated mice.
Our recent results have also shown that ICOS+ regulatory T cells are present in the colon of untreated mice, but absent in axenic animals, suggesting that their development is dependent on the intestinal flora. We will complete our experiments to further test the role of CD70 in Th1 priming in the presence or absence of regulatory T cells, and try to identify the mechanism by which these cells may downregulate the CD70 pathway. We will also pursue our study to identify the cells expressing indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase in the colon following anti-CTLA-4 treatment. 

Recent reports have suggested that regulatory T cells may affect the phenotype, survival and function of dendritic cells.
We have therefore tested whether the enhanced Th1 response correlated with increased expression of costimulatory molecules or increased production of IL-12 by dendritic cells. Our data (in vitro and in vivo) clearly show that the phenotype of these cells was not changed in the absence of regulatory T cells and that IL-12 was not required for enhanced Th1 priming. Our preliminary results point to a role of CD70, a membrane-associated molecule of the tumor necrosis  factor family. """ ;

In particular, the most relevant gene upregulated in presence of stimuli typically inducing Th1 responses (LPS, CpG, Poly I:C) but not in presence of the Th2 stimulus, Pam3Cys, was Stat-1. We then evaluated whether STAT-1 was phosphorylated in DC following activation with TLR-dependent Th1 and Th2 stimuli and we found that only in presence of TLR stimuli able to induce Th1 responses STAT-1 was activated. This observation strongly suggested that the molecules selectively produced by DC in presence of Th1 stimuli and not in presence of Th2 stimuli were type I IFNs and that these cytokines were presumably required for NK cell activation. In fact, our preliminary results confirmed this hypothesis with all of the Th1 stimuli tested including the Poly I-C stimulus that mimics viral infections." ;

This defect in Rab27a-deficient DCs results from the impaired recruitment to phagosomes of the NOX2 membrane components. Therefore phagosomal alkalinization by NOX2 is controlled by Rab27a, and is required for efficient cross presentation in DCs." ;

Ciao Damariz,
ho di nuovo cercato un po' e proporrei lo seguente (gli altri, cosa ne dite?):
 
1. inserire nel tuo controlled vocabulary i termini che servono a voi, ad es. human neutrophil ectosome.
2. mettere, nella versione estesa del controlled vocabulary, la definizione come ha l'proposta Andrea. Tipo:
type: \"human neutrophil ectosome\" (qua potrei creare in'ID DCTHERADIR io)
\"human neutrophil ectosomes\" \"derived_from\" \"human neutrophil\" (anche qua potrei creare in'ID DCTHERADIR io)
\"human neutrophil\" isA \"neutrophil\" (con l'ID da un'onto per neutrophil: CL:0000775)
 
Forse ectosome potrebbe, nell'ontologia DCTHERADIR, diventare una sottoclasse di http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ego/GTerm?id=GO:0031988 ?? (membrane-bound vesicle) Secondo te avrebbe senso o meno?"""^^xsd:string ;

      rdfs:comment """Our lab has obtained data on the dependence of IL-10 as well as IL-12 production on signalling adaptor molecules.

Dendritic cells (DC) arise in the bone marrow and circulate through blood or tissue; upon pathogen challenge DC subsequently migrate to lymphoid organs to initiate immune responses (Banchereau et al., 1998). DC act as sentinels for pathogens forming the interface between the innate and adaptive immune response. In addition they are flexible in driving both Th1 and Th2 responses (Boonstra, Rajsbaum et al., 2003). Mouse DC can be derived from bone marrow (BM), which, after culture results in myeloid DC and plasmacytoid precursor DC (pDC), or can be directly isolated from the spleen, lymph nodes or tissue as classical DC (CD11cbright, CD8+ or CD8-) or plasmacytoid pDC. 

We have shown that macrophages, myeloid DC and plasmacytoid DC have the intrinsic capacity to produce different amounts of IL-12 upon stimulation through TLR9 and TLR4.  Some of this, but not all is accounted for by endogenous IL-10 production which inhibits the subsequent production of IL-12. In this respect we have identified specific regulatory elements in the IL-10 locus which are present in DC and macrophages but not T cells (Saraiva et al., 2005). 

We have now shown that both IL-10 as well as IL-12 production is dependent on the signalling adaptor molecules either MyD88 or TRIF, respectively in response to CpG, LPS or PolyIC. This work has been published in the J.Immunology (Boonstra, Rajsbaum et al, 2006).""" ;

The DC-THERA Directory is intended to collect and semantically organize this data and to serve as a tool for collaboration among researchers and as a reference point for the information contained. As such it is a directory that provides summarized information and relations between resources and people involved. 

In particular, we have defined a data model that mixes aspect of Object Oriented design and RDF-like features (RDF is the language at the basis of the Semantic Web). We have used this data-model to develop the DC-THERA Directory, a web application based on the Symfony web framework and Doctrine, an object-relational mapping (ORM).

As for the content of the directory, it has initially been populated it with information drawn from DC-THERA annual reports.

The semantic organization of the directory is based on fragments of standard ontologies, in particular OBI (Ontology for Biomedical Investigation) and terminologies developed within DC-ATLAS.
The first release of the DC-THERA directory was based on this information and ontologies, and provided the skeleton of the application, as well as a set of basic functionalities (semantic links among entities, lexical variations and generalization in searches).
Following this release, we have assembled a panel of reviewers, we have authored a document describing current functionalities and aims of the project, and we have asked for feedback on the current release as a well as a ranking, by relevance, of future functionalities to be implemented.

We will continue the development of functionalities of the DC-THERA Directory, following suggestions from reviewers and the user-base, and fostering the integration with other DC-THERA resources.

We studied two major blood populations of DCs, myeloid DCs (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). Among mDCs, three populations could be further identified by specific markers: CD16, CD1c and BDCA-3. The properties of these DC populations and their production of cytokines in response to different Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists were evaluated. The TLR agonists used were: PAM3CSK4, Poly I:C, LPS, Flagellin, Imiquimod, Resiquimod, CpG 2216, CpG 2006. While BDCA-3+ cells seem not have any capability to respond to TLR agonists, CD16 and CD1c produce a number of cytokines in response to these stimuli, with the exception of CpGs. In addition, we have found that CD16+ DCs are the major producers of TNF-alpha and IL-6, while CD1c+ DCs produce primarily IL-8.""" ;

      dc:description "ABSTRACT: Clear cell sarcoma is a unique soft tissue tumor with distinct microscopic features that include a nested or fascicular pattern of spindle cells accompanied by larger wreath-like giant cells scattered throughout. It harbors a unique EWSR1-ATF1 gene fusion secondary to a t(12;22)(q13;q12) translocation. Recently, it was reported that clear cell sarcoma can occur in the skin and mimic a broad spectrum of entities, including spindle cell melanoma. Here, we describe 3 new cases of clear cell sarcoma of the skin, all of which were confirmed molecularly. The patients, a 12-year-old boy, a 29-year-old woman, and a 60-year-old man, had cutaneous lesions on the thigh, dorsum of foot, and sole, respectively. All 3 lesions were originally considered suspicious of spindle cell melanoma. Microscopically, the lesions featured nodular proliferation centered in the dermis that consisted of discrete fascicles of spindle cell enmeshed by thin fibrous strands. Wreath-like cells were present in all cases. Tumor cells were positive for S100 protein (3 of 3 cases), melan A (2 of 3 cases), HMB 45 (1 of 3 cases) although a junctional melanocytic proliferation was seen in 1 case. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was negative in 2 patients. Follow-up was uneventful in 2 patients, whereas the other patient developed a lymph node metastasis 5 months after primary tumor excision. This study confirms that malignant dermal tumors that mimic but do not exactly replicate spindle cell melanoma should raise suspicion for cutaneous clear cell sarcoma and prompt the investigation for the confirmatory gene fusion t(12;22)." ;

Interestingly the suppressive effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 was associated with a potent impairment of DC migration in response to inflammatory and lymph node homing chemokines, thus unraveling a novel mechanism involved in 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated immunomodulation. Experiments to characterise the molecular mechanisms underlining this inhibitory effect, including the expression of ILT-receptors and a panel of adhesion molecules known for their role in leukocyte migration are ongoing. Further studies are focussed on the dissection of the signal transduction pathway of 1,25(OH)2D3 in DCs, and on its interference with chemokine receptor signalling. " ;

We show with this plugin how the use of ontological knowledge in biological analysis can be extended through the use of inference. In particular, we present two examples relative to ontologies representing biological pathways: we demonstrate how these can be abstracted and visualized as interaction networks, and how reasoning on causal dependencies within elements of pathways can be implemented.

A core component of RDFScape was re-engineered in 2008 for continuing ‘Affymetrix’ analyses. This component allows the definition of functions based on ontology patterns, and their computation on numeric values. It is intended in particular to be used to define pathway scoring functions, based on microarray data, that will include  causal and functional information found in pathway ontologies.

This project is relevant also for the Pathway based analysis and it now attributes an increased value to pathway-based information. For these reasons, we have chosen to provide this module as independent from RDFScape.

We will explore the possibilities offered by RDFScape and the related function evaluator on pathways curated within DC-THERA and the database provided by Duccio Cavalieri.""" ;

The positive influence of a reactive lymph node on the priming of CD8+ T-cells was already analyzed in 2007. We set up experiments to determine if this effect would benefit a response against a second infection. We infected mice with CD8+ T-cells primed with or without the influence of a reactive lymph node with a flu-virus encoding the specific antigen. After several days we determined the viral load in the lungs with RT-PCR. The results show that in mice with CD8+ T-cells primed with a reactive lymph node the viral load in the lungs was significantly smaller then in a control mice. 
We also determined that suboptimally primed CD8+ T-cells can develop into functional memory cells. Although suboptimally primed CD8+ T-cells do not display good effector function, as previously enclosed, we found that they were efficient at eradicating tumors in the memory phase. 
Micro-array data obtained from samples from suboptimally primed CD8+ T-cells compared with optimally primed CD8+ T-cells showed several interesting genes involved in regulation of proliferation and development. 
 
We are currently working on verifying the data obtained with micro-arrays through RT-PCR, and comparing data from in vitro primed CD8+ T-cells to in vivo primed CD8+ T-cells. We intend to analyse the candidate genes through overexpression and siRNA experiments.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """During 2008, we extended all the data regarding TLR3 signaling to TLR8 signaling. Cytokines assays and immunoblotting studies suggest that Src kinases play a crucial role in the control of both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways. We also extended microarray analysis on human MoDC stimulated with R848 (TLR8 agonist), pretreated or not with PP2. In summary, the new generated data on TLR8 triggered gene expression are similar to previous data obtained with TLR3 stimulation, and confirmed that src kinases inhibition is associated to inhibition of key genes in the inflammatory cytokine response. Interestingly, however, the expression of IL-23 p19 was not decreased by PP2. Cytokine assays, indeed, showed that inhibition of Src kinases in human DC stimulated with TLR agonists alone or simultaneously resulted in a dramatic unbalance in the production of IL-12 and IL-23 :since IL-12 impairment was associated to a normal production of IL-23. Moreover the finding that IL-23 is not affected by PP2 treatment was also confirmed in a murine system of Bone Marrow derived Dendritic Cells stimulated with TLR agonists. Real-time qPCR in human MoDC showed that mRNA levels for IL-23A subunit exactly correlated with IL-23 cytokine levels suggesting that the IL-23A chain is the limiting component for the production of a complete IL-23 complex. Moreover,  transcriptional analysis showed that the role of Src kinases on specific transcription factors accounts for unbalanced IL-12/IL-23 production.

We will investigate if normal IL-23 production associated to inhibition of IL-12 observed upon stimulation of PP2-treated MoDC would result in a milieu able to induce a Th17 response. Eventually we will evaluate if src kinase inhibitors are able to modulate in-vivo the type of DC driven immune response.""" ;

Unlike in other species, the establishment of primary equine melanoma cultures that could be used to develop new therapeutic approaches has remained a major challenge. The purpose of the study was to develop a protocol for routine isolation and cultivation of primary equine melanocytes. Melanoma tissues were excised from 13 horses under local anesthesia, mainly from the perianal area. The melanoma cells were isolated from the melanoma tissue by serial enzymatic digestion using dispase and collagenase. Out of the 13 excised melanomas, cell cultures from eight melanomas were established, which corresponded to a success rate 62%. These cells showed different degrees of melanin pigmentation. Characterization of these cells using confocal microscopy, FACs analysis and western blotting showed that they expressed melanoma-associated antigens; Melan-A, MAGE-1, and MAGE-3, and PCNA expression was higher in fast-proliferating isolates. The protocol we developed and established proved successful for routine isolation and cultivation of primary equine melanoma cells. This method provided a large number of primary equine melanoma cells that could be used to study new therapeutic approaches for treatment of equine melanomas." ;

We used semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to determine the levels of expression of survivin and XIAP in 30 patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Survivin and XIAP overexpression were detected in 36.7% and 43.3% of cases, respectively. Patients with overexpression of either survivin or XIAP showed unfavorable response to chemotherapy in 81.2% and 91.7%, respectively. Also, these cases showed shorter median survival time (30 days) compared to patients with normal expression of either survivin or XIAP (150 days and 180 days). Patients with overexpression of both survivin and XIAP showed unfavorable response to induction therapy in 100% of the patients and the shortest median survival (30 days). These findings suggest that survivin and XIAP may have a role in leukemogenesis and provide prognostic information." ;

DC present peripheral Ags to T cells in lymph nodes, but also influence their differentiation (tolerance/immunity, Th1/Th2). To investigate how peripheral conditions affect DC properties and might subsequently regulate T cell differentiation, we examined the effects of a potent DC-activating, TLR-4-mediated stimulus, LPS, on rat intestinal and hepatic DC in vivo. Our results suggest that any explanation of switching between tolerance and immunity as well as involving changes in DC activation status must also take into account differential migration of DC subsets.""" ;

(i) the transcriptional regulation of DC differentiation, and 
(ii) the safe and rationale in vitro manipulation of gene expression in DCs. 

One of the two different approaches that have been set up in parallel is: 

Transient transfection of synthetic siRNA: to this aim, commercially available siRNA Smart Pool from Dharmacon targeted against the STAT3 transcription factor have been successfully transfected in human MDDCs (Lipofectamine 2000 as transfection reagent). The efficiency of silencing, as detected by western blot or FACS analysis of the protein was of 50-80% (depending on the donor), and peaked at 72 h post-transfection. Transfection efficiency was reproducibly higher than 80% and did not induce any type I IFN production. A total of 9  different donors have been transfected under these optimized conditions and a detailed analysis of the phenotypic and functional consequences of STAT3 silencing have been performed upon 

(a) Toll-like receptor (TLR) mediated DC activation (e.g LPS or pI:C) and 
(b) activation in a tolerogenic microenvironment (e.g. combined stimulation TLR-L + IL-10). 

In particular, we analysed the immunophenotype, the antigen up-take activity, the secretion of cytokines/chemokines, and the ability of silenced MDDCs to stimulate T cell allogenic proliferation in classical MLR assays. 

No consistent and reproducible differences in the immunophenotype and antigene uptake capability of both iMDDCs and TLR-matured MDDCs have been observed. Modest inhibitory effects have instead been observed in the production IL-10 and IL-6, whose biological activity is controlled through STAT3. We noticed, however, that the transfection itself caused a non specific activation of MDDCs (of variable extent from donor to donor) that rendered difficult the interpretation of the results (especially MLR).

Global microarrays were used to define differentially modulated genes in STAT3 silenced MDDCs versus control cells.""" ;

As part of this work, we have used microscopy to study the effect of Dectin-1 uptake on its ability to signal for downstream responses. Finally, we have shown that fluorescently-labelled antibodies against a novel C-type lectin, DNGR-1, can be used to mark DC upon injection into mice and might therefore be useful for in vivo imaging studies.

Microscopy will continue to be used to understand molecular dynamics in cell biology and immunology, including studies of signalling pathways in dendritic cells. In particular, we are using imaging approached to define the endocytic ability of DNGR-1 and its ability to intersect with antigen processing compartments. We are also creating knock-in and transgenic reporter mice in which specific mouse DC subsets are  marked with fluorescent proteins for in vivo imaging studies.""" ;

The C-type lectin L-SIGN is expressed on liver and lymph node endothelial cells,where it serves as a receptor for a variety of carbohydrate ligands, including ICAM-3, Ebola, and HIV. To consider targeting liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (L-SIGN) for therapeutic purposes in autoimmunity and infectious disease, we isolated and characterized Fabs that bind strongly to L-SIGN, but to a lesser degree or not at all to dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN). As a first step to consider the potential of these Abs for Ab-mediated Ag delivery, we evaluated specific peptide delivery to human dendritic cells. A durable human T cell response was induced when a tetanus toxide epitope embedded into a L-SIGN/DC-SIGN-cross-reactive Ab was targeted to dendritic cells. We believe that the isolated Abs may be useful for selective delivery of Ags to DC-SIGN- or L-SIGN-bearing APCs for the modulation of immune responses and for blocking viral infections.""" ;

There have been only 4 cases reported in the literature in English, all of them occurring in middle-aged to elderly patients. Here, we report a case of renal hemangioblastoma in a young adult without clinical evidence of von Hippel-Lindau disease. The tumor was composed of polygonal cells with mildly eosinophilic to clear cytoplasm and a rich vascular network. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a typical profile (positivity for α-inhibin, neuron-specific enolase and S100; negative results for epithelial membrane antigen, HMB-45, and Melan-A), which confirmed the diagnosis. Despite the similarity to renal-cell carcinoma in morphology, hemangioblastoma of the kidney is clinically indolent. Correct recognition of this pathological entity is important to avoid overdiagnosis and unnecessary clinical treatment." ;

DC loaded with a single MAA-derived peptide (MAGE-3.A1 or -A2 or Na17.A2) or pulsed with 2 to 3 MAA-derived peptides (combinations of MAGE-3.A2, MAGE-C2.A2 or Na17.A2) or G4-DC loaded with 8 different peptides. 

Our experiences can be summarized as follows: 
(1) preparation of an autologous dendritic cell based vaccine was feasible for every patient enrolled in our studies; 
(2) we did not observe vaccination related toxicities beside mild local skin reactions (CTCAEv3.0 grade 1/2) at the injection sites; 
(3) objective tumor regression was observed in 4 patients (1 CR and 1 CR after resection of residual disease following regression of metastases) on a total of 10 patients that were able to receive the planned 6 biweekly vaccinations; 
(4) all patients with regression of melanoma lesions following vaccination were found to have mounted a significant increase in the frequency of vaccine specific CTL in their peripheral blood and the appearance of a measurable CTL-frequency was seen between 8-13w after the first vaccine, furthermore, regression or stabilization of metastases has been coincident with the appearance of detectable or a significant rise (>10-fold) of CTL-frequencies; 
(5) 2 patients with no residual disease following surgical metastasectomy who were vaccinated remain disease free at >18 months of follow-up, one of these patients qualifies for a CTL-response, the other for a borderline response; 
(6) CTL-responses have been observed in 1 out of 3 patients treated with a mRNA-G4DC vaccine; this small number of patients does not allow for a comparison of efficacy between mRNA and MAA-peptide pulsed DC-vaccines.  

An important conclusion that can be made from these pilot-observations is that the potential therapeutic effect of our DC-based MAA-vaccination approach does not occur instantly but is delayed by 8-12w following the first vaccination (i.e.12-16w after the isolation of PBMC by leukapheresis given the 4w that are necessary for preparation of the DC-vaccine and the extensive quality control).

These procedures allowed simultaneously measurement of different cytokines in the same supernatants. The multiplex assay format differs from conventional ELISA in one significant way: the multiplex capture antibody is attached to a polystyrene bead whereas the ELISA capture antibody is attached to the microplate well. The use of the suspension bead-based technology enables multiplexing. Microspheres are internally dyed with red and infrared fluorophores of differing intensities. Each bead is given a unique number, or bead region, allowing differentiation of one bead from another. Beads covalently bound to different antibodies can be mixed in the same assay, utilizing a 96-well microplate format.
At the completion of the sandwich immunoassay, beads were read, using the Bioplex® 200™ detection system, in single-file by dual lasers for classification and quantification of each analyte. 
Alternatively, ELISA assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ELISA kits were from Biosource rather than ELISA for IL-12p70 that was from R&D System and IL-17 from e-Bioscience.

The gene for this molecule, which we have termed Japanin, has been cloned and recombinant protein has been generated. This material inhibits the up-regulation of costimulatory molecules in response to certain TLR agonists, and some cytokines but not others, and modulates the function of the DC in ‘in vitro’ assays. A patent was filed by CEH in September 2008 with Austyn named as inventor relating to the potential use of Japanin as a DC modulator for human therapy.""" ;

Using curdlan as a specific agonist of dectin-1, we have shown that this C-type lectin couple to Syk kinase leads to activation of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPKs, as well as NF-kappaB. However, signalling terminates rapidly once the receptor is internalised, thereby explaining previous observations that large, non-phagocytisable Dectin-1 ligands are much more potent agonists than smaller ones.

This is the first example of a bona fide signalling pathway from a cell surface innate receptor other than a TLR. 

We will continue to study innate signalling pathways in dendritic cells. Our focus will be on TLR-independent signalling pathways involved in viral recognition, including RIG-I and MDA5, as well as signalling via C-type lectins related to Dectin-1, such as Dectin-2 and DNGR-1.""" ;

This is important and essential for implementation of the technology into clinical immune monitoring in e.g. vaccination trials.

Moreover, the affect of stimulation length was determined. Differences with respect to the induced frequencies of antigen-specific, activated CD154+ Th-cells were minor. Interestingly, longer stimulation times (16h) were characterised by a slightly reduced coefficient of variation. However, longer stimulation times resulted also in slightly enhanced background, implying that overnight stimulations cannot be performed when low frequencies of antigen-specific Th-cells are expected (Meier, Stark et al., 2008).

It was created from the merger of the Department of Clinical Immunology at the Motol Teaching Hospital and the Institute of Immunology of the Second Medical Faculty into a single institution active in health care and teaching. Since 1995, the Institute of Immunology underwent many changes in terms of the organization of its activities, a significant expansion of its health care and teaching components and an intensifying of its research activities. The Institute is awarded research grants from the Ministries of Education a Health and International EU grants. Employees of the institute published many original articles in renowned journals and are authors of textbooks and monographs. At present, the Institute is one of the most significant immunology workplaces in the Czech Republic; it plays an important role through the cooperation with other departments of the Motol Teaching Hospital in the diagnosis and treatment of primary immunodeficiencies, autoimmune disorders and leukemia primarily in children. Successful developments in the field of cancer immunology based on the research into tumour vaccines on the basis of dendritic cells. In 2003, the Institute was recognized as a workplace fulfilling the requirements of the American Federation of Societies for Clinical Immunology (FOCIS) and became part of the international chain of Centers for Clinical Immunology.

* Immunotherapy
Research Aim: Long term goal of the group of tumor immunotherapy is the development of dendritic cell based cancer vaccine. Administration of this vaccine should induce tumor cell-specific induce response and contribute to current treatment options. Dendritic cells represent the most efficient antigen presenting cells as they activate primary immune response. Protocols developed in 1990s allow for generation of large numbers of dendritic cells from monocytes circulating in peripheral blood. Dendritic cell biology and their use in the immunotherapy of tumors have been studied at the Institute of Immunology for more than 10 years as documented by the list of publications . In collaboration with renowned European laboratories, we develop protocols for dendritic cell-based vaccines for the treatment of ovarian cancer, prostate cancer and for patients with hematological malignancies. First step of vaccine development is generation of large numbers of denritic cells from patient's monocytes. Dendritic cells are then incubated with various forms of tumor antigens, activated and subsequently administered to patients in defined vaccination programs. Cancer vaccine generation has to be done under strictly aseptic conditions. In 2007, University hospital Motol built a Cell therapy unit, first unit in Czech republic that allows for generation of clinical grade products for cellular therapy, including cancer vaccines. 

Principal Investigators prof. Jirina Bartunková, M.D., Ph.D., MBA., Radek Špíšek, M.D., Ph.D. 

Financial support: Research of dendritic cells at the Institute of Immunology, Charles University, 2nd Medical School has been supported by grants from Ministry of Education, grant agencies, grants form European Union.

      dc:description "OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary complications are frequent during acute pancreatitis (AP). We investigate the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on lung injury in mild and severe AP. ANIMALS AND TREATMENT: Mild and severe AP was induced in rats by bile-pancreatic duct obstruction (BPDO) and infusion of 3.5 % sodium taurocholate (NaTc) into the bile-pancreatic duct, respectively. NAC (50 mg/kg) was given 1 h before and 1 h after AP. METHODS: Amylase activity was measured in plasma. Lungs were harvested for mRNA expression analysis of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC), P-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and histological examination. RESULTS: Hyperamylasemia was reduced by NAC in both AP models. NAC down-regulated MCP-1, CINC and P-selectin in BPDO- but not in NaTc-induced AP. Pulmonary insults did not vary in mild AP and were exacerbated in severe AP by NAC treatment. NAC reduced lung MPO activity in mild but not in severe AP. CONCLUSIONS: Although NAC treatment down-regulated inflammatory mediators in lungs during AP it did not prevent leukocyte infiltration, which could be responsible for maintaining the lung injury. As a result, NAC aggravated the lung damage in severe AP and failed to exert beneficial effects in the mild disease model." ;

Efforts on the definition of a novel way of monitoring DC and T cell activation as well as studying viral infections were finalized. The puromycin-based technology (SUnSET, surface sensing of translation) was applied to monitor translation by FACs during DC/T cell interaction in presence or absence of cognate antigenic peptides. It was demonstrated that translation activation is an excellent read-out for early antigen specific T cell activation by DCs. Surprisingly, this phenomenon was mTOR independent (Rapamycin insensitive).""" ;

      dc:description "SUMMARY This study reports a global proteomic analysis of pancreatic cancer cells that describes how flux through the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway selectively modulates a subset of N-glycosylation sites found within cellular proteins. These results provide evidence that sialoglycoprotein patterns are not determined exclusively by the transcription of biosynthetic enzymes or the availability of N-glycan sequons; instead, bulk metabolic flux through the sialic acid pathway has a remarkable ability to increase the abundance of certain sialoglycoproteins while having a minimal impact on others. Specifically, of 82 glycoproteins identified through a mass spectrometry and bioinformatics approach, ~31% showed no change in sialylation, ~29% exhibited a modest increase, while ~40% experienced an increase of greater than 2-fold. Increased sialylation of specific glycoproteins resulted in changes to the adhesive properties of SW1990 pancreatic cancer cells (e.g., increased CD44-mediated adhesion to selectins under physioloigcal flow and enhanced integrin-mediated cell mobility on collagen and fibronectin). These results indicate that cancer cells can become more aggressively malignant by controlling the sialylation of proteins implicated in metastatic transformation via metabolic flux." ;

Conceived by Umberto Veronesi and inaugurated in May 1994, the Institute became a research hospital and treatment centre (IRCCS or “Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico”) through the Ministerial Decree issued in January 1996. The European Institute of Oncology adopts the non-profit private-law organisation model and provides services through agreements with Italy’s National Health Service. 


 
In keeping with the standards of the most advanced international oncology centres, the Institute fully integrates different activities involved in the fight against cancer: prevention and diagnosis, health education and training, research and treatment.""" ;

This procedure allowed to obtain highly pure fractions of each subset. However, because DC are a very rare population, this method is very material- and cost-intensive. Furthermore, it is not surprising that the obtained cell numbers of each subset after isolation are below 107. However, these cell numbers should be sufficient for proteomic investigations. The proteomes of all three subsets using mass spectrometry is in progress." ;

We have identified that IL-10 plays an early and transient role in the control of the immune response to MTb and now show that this involves enhanced migration of IFNgamma producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells into the lung rather than enhanced mycobacterial killing. The effects are accompanied by enhanced G-CSF, GM-CSF, TNF, IL-6 and IL-17 levels although the enhanced clearance of bacilli in IL-10 deficient mice we now show is independent of IL-17." ;

The mass was initially diagnosed as an invasive, poorly differentiated carcinoma; however, on further review and immunohistochemical workup, the diagnosis of signet-ring cell melanoma was made. The lesion consisted of oval to round epithelioid cells undermining the gastric mucosa and infiltrating the muscularis mucosae. Tumor cells demonstrated abundant cytoplasm and eccentrically located nuclei, many with signet-ring cell morphology. The tumor cells were negative for mucin and pancytokeratin, strongly positive for S100 protein and Melan-A, and focally but strongly positive for human melanoma black-45. Diagnostic imaging failed to prove another site of melanoma, and no history of melanoma or cutaneous lesion was reported by the patient. Therefore, it was determined this was likely a primary lesion. We review the literature and previously reported cases of this rare histologic variant of melanoma." ;

Surprisingly, instead of a single program of differentiation leading to the coordinated expression of all effector genes; we found that individual effector genes had different kinetics of expression and associated randomly generating several new effector cell types. These results are published in J. Exp. Med. Since these results were obtained in TCR-Tg mice, and thus could be different from those of normal cells, we initiated a long program comparing the behaviour of TCR-Tg cells specific for GP-33 peptide, with LCMV-specific populations: 

1) sharing the same GP33 specificity 
1a) present either in the same or 
1b) in normal mice; 

2) or other LCMV peptide specificities. 

We thus could demonstrate that the rules established for TCR-Tg cells also apply to endogenous T cells i.e, all CD8 T cells behave similarly. This Ms. is submitted to publication. """ ;

We focused on the monitoring of tumour antigen specific CD4+ T cell responses. We select the following tumour associated antigens: 
i) the E6 and E7 proteins of human papilloma viruses, 
ii) the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and 
iii) the tumour specific antigen MAGE-A3. 

We investigated spontaneous CD4+ T cell responses to these antigens in normal donors and in patients with high-grade cervical lesions, pancreas adenocarcinoma and advanced melanoma. HPV-18 E6 specific CD4+ T cells were found in a high percentage of patients with cervical lesions and we showed that the quality of the response (i.e. the level of IFN-? produced) could predict the clinical outcome after surgery. CEA specific CD4+ T cells were found both in normal donors and in patients but CD4+ T cells from the patients compared to normal donors showed impaired IFN-gamma production. MAGE-A3 specific CD4+ T cells were found also in a high percentage of melanoma patients but CD4+ T cells showed an unpolarized or Th2 skewed phenotype. We have optimized the MAGE-A3 peptides to load onto HLA-DR*1101 tetramers. """ ;

Structural works that have been performed to up-grade the GMP facility for conduction of phase III clinical trials has limited the number of patients recruited. Nonetheless, we were able to complete the vaccination schedule in 4 patients and to perform additional injections in disease free patients, in patients with stable disease or with slowly progressive disease. We could not recruit new patients because the generation in GMP conditions of additional aliquots of the vaccines (i.e. the supernatant containing the infective MAGE-3 encoding viruses and the natural tumour peptides) is taking longer then predicted because of new viral controls required by the Regulatory Agency and of difficulties in purchasing clinical grade dialysis’ membranes for peptides production. As far as the planning of new protocols concerns we are waiting to know whether grant applications we applied for the specific issues will be funded.

Thus so far the 2 clinical trials are on hold until problems in GMP production of the vaccine have been solved.""" ;

      dc:description "BACKGROUND: Brain metastases commonly develop in patients with melanoma and are a frequent cause of death of patients with this disease. Ipilimumab improves survival in patients with advanced melanoma. We aimed to investigate the safety and activity of this drug specifically in patients with brain metastases. METHODS: Between July 31, 2008, and June 3, 2009, we enrolled patients with melanoma and brain metastases from ten US centres who were older than 16 years into two parallel cohorts. Patients in cohort A were neurologically asymptomatic and were not receiving corticosteroid treatment at study entry; those in cohort B were symptomatic and on a stable dose of corticosteroids. Patients were to receive four doses of 10 mg/kg intravenous ipilimumab, one every 3 weeks. Individuals who were clinically stable at week 24 were eligible to receive 10 mg/kg intravenous ipilimumab every 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with disease control, defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease after 12 weeks, assessed with modified WHO criteria. Analyses of safety and efficacy included all treated patients. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00623766. FINDINGS: We enrolled 72 patients: 51 into cohort A and 21 into cohort B. After 12 weeks, nine patients in cohort A exhibited disease control (18%, 95% CI 8-31), as did one patient in cohort B (5%, 0·1-24). When the brain alone was assessed, 12 patients in cohort A (24%, 13-38) and two in cohort B (10%, 1-30) achieved disease control. We noted disease control outside of the brain in 14 patients (27%, 16-42) in cohort A and in one individual (5%, 0·1-24) in cohort B. The most common grade 3 adverse events in cohort A were diarrhoea (six patients [12%]) and fatigue (six [12%]); in cohort B, they were dehydration (two individuals [10%]), hyperglycaemia (two [10%]), and increased concentrations of serum aspartate aminotransferase (two [10%]). One patient in each cohort had grade 4 confusion. The most common grade 3 immune-related adverse events were diarrhoea (six patients [12%]) and rash (one [2%]) in cohort A, and rash (one individual [5%]) and increased concentrations of serum aspartate aminotransferase (two [10%]) in cohort B. One patient in cohort A died of drug-related complications of immune-related colitis. INTERPRETATION: Ipilimumab has activity in some patients with advanced melanoma and brain metastases, particularly when metastases are small and asymptomatic. The drug has no unexpected toxic effects in this population. FUNDING: Bristol-Myers Squibb." ;

We propose the role of cell wall in the mechanisms of DC-Pathogen interaction as an experiment that could serve as reference in bioinformatics approaches for the reconstruction of DC activation signalling pathways. We have stimulated human Monocyte derived Dendritic Cells (hMoDC) with yeast, spheroplasts, pseudohyphae, spores, purified RNA and not purified RNA, LPS. We have measured IL-6, IL-8, TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IFNgamma, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-12p40. We are performing transcriptional analysis on the above mentioned samples, using the Genomics facilities at Genopolis (P32). The results are being analyzed with DC_Eu.Gene Analyzer and compared with other experiments in order to identify DC- and immunological pathway differentially affected by the different stimuli. 

We have collaborated actively with Ugo D'Oro, Giorgio Napolitani, Federica Sallusto and Antonio Lanzavecchia. This integration of efforts and information is instrumental to the fruition of the genomics information in the field of dendritic cells research. Regarding the knowledge portal, we submitted microarray data and SOPS on the above mentioned experiments. """ ;

In 2007, we have finalized analysis of the receptors on DCs responsible for capture of exosomes secreted by mature DCs. We have shown that expression of LFA-1, but not of Mac-1, integrin, on DCs is required for capture of ICAM-1-bearing exosomes. Furthermore, the CD8+ subpopulation of DCs in lymph nodes expresses LFA-1 at higher levels than the CD8- subpopulation, and is responsible for in vivo capture of injected exosomes. We have thus proposed a new role for LFA-1 on DCs, as a receptor to favor antigen transfer via exosomes in vivo. These results have been published in 2007 (Segura et al, JI)." ;

We have assessed and obtained data on cell death in the viable epidermis by non-invasive near infrared two-photon microscopy following micro-particle bombardment of murine skin. We showed that the ballistic delivery of micro-particles to the viable epidermis can result in localised cell death. Furthermore, experimental results show the degree of cell death is dependant on the number of micro-particles delivered per unit of tissue surface area. These results suggest that optimization of transfection by genes administered with gene guns is - among other effects - a compromise of micro-particle payload and cell death. " ;

Its intuitive graphical user interface makes it an easy and flexible tool, even for the first-time user. Eu.Gene supports a variety of array platforms, organisms and pathway ontologies, transparently deals with multiple nomenclature systems and seamlessly integrates data from different sources. Two different statistical methods, the Fisher Exact Test and the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), are implemented to identify biological pathways transcriptionally affected under experimental conditions. A suite of tools is offered to define, visualize and share custom non-redundant pathway sets. 

In conclusion, Eu.Gene Analyzer is a new software application that takes advantage of information from multiple pathway databases to build a comprehensive interpretation of experimental results in a simple, intuitive environment.

Meanwhile, we have developed a new version of EuGene,  EuGene 1.5,  now available for download from the new EuGene Website at www.duccioknights.org,which has several advantages:
a-Adds new functionality or optimize already present features to meet the requirements for DC-STUDIO. 
b-set up a method to convert pathway deregulation into a categorical value, the signed Binary Enrichment Factor (sBEF),  a three state variable (significantly up-regulated, significantly down-regulated and not significant) associated to each pathway of the curated pathway set for a particular sample. DC-STUDIO was engineered to store collections of sBEFs, as a sort of “barcodes”, for each sample analyzed, in a way that would be compatible with future integration with DC-BASE. """ ;

To improve existing strategies, the amplitude and polarisation of T cell responses was monitored in the presence or absence of regulatory T cells. Natural regulatory T cells (CD4+ CD25+) were depleted by injection of anti-CD25 mAbs, whereas regulatory T cells were induced by injection of (presumably agonistic) anti-CTLA-4 mAbs. Our observations demonstrate that natural and CTLA-4 induced regulatory T cells are distinct populations. Both cell types downregulate Th1-type responses, suggesting new strategies to optimize DC-based immunotherapy to induce tumor resistance. " ;

HIV causes a disseminated infection and spreads in all newly generated lymphoid tissues, thus closely resembling HIV infection in humans. However, as in EBV infected animals, adaptive T and B cell responses were not consistently detected.

Thus, although these “humanized” mice represent a major step forward in generating an in vivo preclinical testing system, they still harbor limitations as inconsistent/weak adaptive immune responses, questionable T (and B) cell selection, insufficient human hematopoietic stem cell maintenance, and myeloid cell constitution. To address these issues, we are now aiming to improve the recipient mouse background by co-transplanting human mesenchymal stroma cells, and by adding human cytokines as well as human MHC. Furthermore, we use the mice to evaluate targeted therapies directed at human immune system cells as T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells.""" ;

Human blood contains myeloid (mDCs) and plasmacytoid (pDCs) dendritic cells that differ in cytokine secretion pattern and responsiveness to microbial stimuli. We found that LPS-stimulated mDCs are able to induce up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules on co-cultured pDCs. Likewise, CpG-stimulated pDCs activate co-cultured mDCs. The cross talk between these two populations of DC is very efficient since it can be observed at mDC/pDC ratio ranging from 1/10 to 10/1. Activation of the co-cultured population is restricted to up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules since it does not involve cytokine secretion by the indirectly activated cells. The process is cell contact-dependent, although CD40-CD40L interaction is not involved, but it is also partly dependent on soluble factors. Indeed TNFa produced by LPS-activated mDCs plays a role in the activation of the co-cultured pDC. On the other hand type I interferons produced by CpG-activated pDCs is required for activation of the mDC. We also observed a strong synergistic response of both cell types, using limiting conditions of stimulus on co-cultured mDCs and pDCs. 

The study on the response of human MoDC to yeast, spheroplasts, pseudohyphae and spores was performed in collaboration with Duccio Cavalieri's group (partner 15). Analysis of IL-6, IL-8, TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IFNgamma, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-12p40 secretion was performed with a multiplex assay.
We will evaluate the capacity of MoDC stimulated by different forms of S. cerevisiae and Candida albicans to differentially induce T cell polarization.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """We have obtained data on a possible cooperation between myeloid and plasmacytoid DCs in response to different microbial stimuli and a characterization of the mechanisms of this cooperation. For this, we have studied co-culture of mDCs and pDCs in response to CpGs, LPS and bacterial particles. 

Taking advantage on the fact that human myeloid and plasmacitoid DC show a selective response to LPS and CpG respectively, we have previously identified a cross-talk between two type of cells. Indeed it was observed that LPS-stimulated mDCs are able to induce up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules on co-cultured pDCs. Similarly, CpG-stimulated pDCs activate co-cultured mDCs. Activation of the co-cultured population was restricted to up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules and was partially cell contact-dependent. We have now investigated if co-operation between mDCs and pDCs is able to facilitate the induction of adaptive immunity in conditions of low stimulation, which can be encountered in the very early phase of a pathogen infection or in the presence of very low amounts of pathogen. In particular we analyzed if the synergy between mDCs and pDCs stimulated by their respective selective stimulus is important for increasing their ability at inducing T cell activation. Indeed we established that the mDC/pDC cross-talk has a functional effect on T cell activation. In fact the mDC/pDC cooperation event is able to significantly increase the ability of these cells to drive the proliferation and IFN? production by alloreactive T cells. In addition, we discovered that pDCs are not able to respond to whole fixed or live bacteria and consequently, these cells are incapable of phagocytosing   bacterial particles. These finding strongly suggest that pDCs is a cellular population that plays a very specialized antiviral function, although, through a cross-talk with mDC, it can also be indirectly recruited during a bacterial infection, synergizing in the induction of an adaptive immune response.

We will investigate the molecular mechanism through which a mDC/pDC cross-activation occurs. In particular, since the mDC/pDC cross-talk process that we identified is dependent on cell-contact events, we will try to identify the molecule/s responsible for cross-activation between mDCs and pDCs.

Although these studies allowed us isolate some homogeneous cell types, we yet found heterogeneity within some TEM subsets.

      dc:description "BACKGROUND: Cell surface 6-sulfated glycans play important roles in various immunological events through cell-to-cell interactions. The 6-sulfation process is mediated by 6-sulfotransferase family isoenzymes. We previously demonstrated that GlcNAc6ST-1, one of the isoenzyme genes, is induced by GATA-3 and NF-κB in human helper T (Th) cells. However, transcriptional regulation of HEC-GlcNAc6ST, another isoenzyme important in Th cells, remains unclear. METHODS: 5'-RACE analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and reporter assays were performed to reveal transcriptional regulation of HEC-GlcNAc6ST. RNA-knockdown and forced expression experiments were performed to demonstrate the contribution of HEC-GlcNAc6ST to the 6-sulfated glycan expression. RESULTS: We identified potential binding sites of Sp1, T-bet, and GATA-3 in the HEC-GlcNAc6ST promoter. Reporter assays indicated that transfection of Sp1 enhanced the activity, whereas mithramycin A, an Sp1-specific inhibitor, repressed it. Transfection of T-bet increased the activity, which was inhibited by introducing a mutation into the potential T-bet binding site. GATA-3 alone could not elevate the activity, although co-transfection of protein kinase A, which is known to enhance IL-5 transcription in Th2 cells through phosphorylation of GATA-3, caused elevation. RNA-knockdown and forced expression of HEC-GlcNAc6ST in Jurkat cells down- and up-regulated α2,6-sialylated 6-sulfo N-acetyllactosamine, a preferential ligand for B-cell-specific CD22 antigen, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: T-bet and GATA-3, master transcription factors of Th1-Th2 differentiation, as well as Sp1 control the expression of glycan with cell-adhesion activity by regulating HEC-GlcNAc6ST transcription in Th cells. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: These results may provide a clue to biological regulation of Th-cell interaction with selectins and other carbohydrate-recognition molecules by T-bet and GATA-3." ;

      rdfs:comment """Our lab has obtained data on the role of IL-10 and IDO in relation to Th1 and inflammatory responses in a colitis model tested on mice. IDO appears critical for the regulation of TNBS colitis upon CTLA-4 engagement, as the beneficial effect of anti-CTLA-4 treatment was lost in IDO-deficient mice. By contrast, the absence of IDO did not alter the course of inflammation in mice injected with TNBS only, an unexpected finding which suggests that IDO-dependent counter-regulation requires other factors/cells in addition to IDO production and T cell activation by TNBS. Our observations would suggest a critical role for activated Treg, producing IL-10 and expressing high levels of CTLA-4, ICOS and FoxP3. 

We have investigated the respective role of IL-10 and IDO, both required for Th1 suppression in this model. As IL-10 has been shown to indirectly dampen Th1 responses through the inhibition of IL-12 production by antigen-presenting-cells, we monitored mRNA expression specific for the inducible chain IL-12 p35 in lymph nodes draining the site of injection or in mesenteric lymph nodes of mice instilled intra-colonically with TNBS. Our results clearly show that IL-12 production early after the onset of the response was unaffected by anti-CTLA-4 treatment.  By contrast, our data confirm previous data showing that IL-10 is critical for IDO production by DC in vitro, suggesting that IL-10 may act upstream by modulating the expression of IDO. As IDO expression was detected in the colon but not in the spleen or mesenteric lymph nodes, we postulate that IDO may act as anti-inflammatory agent in the intestine and that IL-10 may inhibit Th1 activation in the lymphoid organs and enhance IDO expression in the gut.

We will complete these experiments by (1) testing whether IL-10 is required for IDO expression in vivo; (2) evaluating the role of ICOShi regulatory T cells in the intestine in steady state conditions and (3) the role of intestinal flora in the development of these cells using axenic mice. In parallel, we are testing whether the population of natural regulatory T cells (CD25+) control immune responses by acting on antigen-presenting-cells and in particular on dendritic cells.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """We have data available on the role of chemokine receptors in regulating migration of mature DC and subsets of effector and memory T cells in secondary lymphoid organs. CCR7 is a chemokine receptor that is expressed by mature DCs and central memory T cells (TCM) and regulate migration of these cells in secondary lymphoid organs in the steady state.  T lymphocytes lacking the lymph node homing receptors L-selectin and CCR7 do not migrate to lymph nodes in the steady state. In contrast it was found that lymph nodes that drain sites of mature DC or adjuvant inoculation recruited L-selectin- CCR7- effector and memory CD8+ T cells. This cell recruitment required CXCR3 expression on T cells and occurred through high endothelial cells (HEV) in concert with HEV luminal expression of the CXCR3 ligand CXCL9. In reactive lymph nodes, recruited T cells established stable interactions with and killed antigen-bearing DC, limiting the ability of these DCs to activate naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The inducible recruitment of blood-borne effector and memory T cells to lymph nodes may represent a mechanism for terminating primary and limiting secondary immune responses. In addition to CD8+ TEM, CD4+ TEM also migrated in a CD62P-dependent fashion into reactive lymph nodes that were induced to stably express CD62P on high endothelial venules. CD4+ TEM, but not naïve or TCM cells, constitutively expressed CD40L at levels sufficient to induce DC maturation in vitro and in vivo in the absence of antigenic stimulation. Presentation of a MOG peptide by TEM-licensed DC was sufficient to induce experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Importantly, DC maturation and autoimmunity were inhibited by antibodies to CD62P that prevented CD4+ TEM migration into lymph nodes. These results provide a mechanistic link between lymphocyte traffic in lymph nodes and induction of autoimmune diseases.

We are currently investigating how CDP to cDC and pDC development is guided by external stimuli in vitro and in vivo. To this end, we evaluate the differentiation pathways upon inflammatory stimuli as TLR agonists. Furthermore, we have generated cytokine deficient animals (GM-CSF-/-Flt3L-/-) with the intention to test the combined effects of these cytokines on DC development in vivo. Also, we are in collaboration with Dr. Tim Sparwasser's laboratory at the TU Munich currently generating Flt3 and Flt3L reporter mice with the intention to elucidate in vivo DC developmental regions in steady state and inflammation in situ.""" ;

      dc:description "Cancer immunotherapy requires potent tumor-specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cell responses, initiated by dendritic cells (DCs). Tumor antigens can be specifically targeted to DCs in vivo by exploiting their expression of C-type lectin receptors (CLR), which bind carbohydrate structures on antigens, resulting in internalization and antigen presentation to T-cells. We explored the potential of glycan-modified liposomes to target antigens to DCs to boost murine and human T-cell responses. Since DC-SIGN is a CLR expressed on DCs, liposomes were modified with DC-SIGN-binding glycans Lewis (Le)(B) or Le(X). Glycan modification of liposomes resulted in increased binding and internalization by BMDCs expressing human DC-SIGN. In the presence of LPS, this led to 100-fold more efficient presentation of the encapsulated antigens to CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells compared to unmodified liposomes or soluble antigen. Similarly, incubation of human moDC with melanoma antigen MART-1-encapsulated liposomes coated with Le(X) in the presence of LPS led to enhanced antigen-presentation to MART-1-specific CD8(+) T-cell clones. Moreover, this formulation drove primary CD8(+) T-cells to differentiate into high numbers of tetramer-specific, IFN-γ-producing effector T-cells. Together, our data demonstrate the potency of a glycoliposome-based vaccine targeting DC-SIGN for CD4(+) and CD8(+) effector T-cell activation. This approach may offer improved options for treatment of cancer patients and opens the way to in situ DC-targeted vaccination." ;

Although multiple mechanisms of Treg action have been proposed, the actual mechanism involved in the suppression of anti tumor T cell responses are still unclear. 
Treg inactivation by anti-CD25 antibodies or by depletion in FoxP3-DTR DEREG mice resulted in effective rejection of the tumors upon adoptive transfer of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Treg inactivation or depletion induces a marked arrest in the migration of anti-tumor CD8+ T cells selectively in tumor-draining lymph nodes. Reduced T cell motility in lymph nodes was associated with an amplification of the effector cells, increased IFN? production, and tumor rejection. 
We also show that Tregs make multiple brief contacts with the CD8+ T cells in the lymph nodes of tumor bearing mice. The frequency of these interactions, but not their duration, was inhibited by the treatment with anti-CD25 antibodies. We conclude that direct contacts between CD8+ T cells and Tregs in tumor-draining lymph nodes may contribute to the inhibition of anti-tumor immune responses. However, we were unable to establish the functional relevance of the direct Treg-CD8+ T cell contacts that we imaged.
Besides, Treg inactivation also induces an increase in the number of dendritic cells (DCs) in these tumor-draining lymph nodes. Therefore Tregs could influence CD8+ T cell arrest by modulating the number of antigen presenting cells in the tumor-draining lymph nodes.

DCs have developed numerous specializations to adapt their internalization pathway to efficient antigen processing. Recruitment of ER components to phagosomes has been postulated as one of the high specializations required to allow exogenous antigens to reach MHC class I pathway. However, no direct evidence of a fusion between those compartments has been reported. We will use a lentiviral-based approach to knock down protein expression of molecules potentially involved in ER-phagosome and we will test how this affect cross presentation in BMDCs.
Also, we are planning to investigate the mechanisms by which Tregs limit DC accumulation in tumor-draining lymph nodes. Preliminary results suggest that Treg may reduce DC survival in tumor draining lymph nodes. Therefore, we will use two photon microscopy to analyse DC survival in vivo and unravel the molecular mechanisms involved.""" ;

DESIGN: Prospective randomized study of patients treated with imiquimod alone vs imiquimod plus a topical retinoid, followed by conservative staged excisions. SETTING: Mohs surgical clinic in an academic institution. Patients  Ninety patients with biopsy-confirmed LM. Interventions  Ninety patients with 91 LMs were randomized into 2 groups. One group received imiquimod, 5%, cream 5 d/wk for 3 months, while the other group also received tazarotene, 0.1%, gel 2 d/wk for 3 months. Following topical therapy, all patients underwent staged excisions and frozen section analysis with Melan-A immunostaining to confirm negative margins. Main Outcome Measure  The presence or absence of residual LM at the time of staged excision. RESULTS: Forty-six patients with 47 LMs were randomized to receive monotherapy: 42 of 47 LMs reached the intended treatment duration, with 27 complete responses (64%). Forty-four patients with 44 LMs were randomized to receive combined therapy: 37 of 44 LMs reached the intended treatment duration, with 29 complete responses (78%). This difference did not reach statistical significance (P = .17). There have been no recurrences to date, with a mean follow-up period of 42 months. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who received topical imiquimod with vs without tazarotene, 22% (8 of 37) of lesions vs 36% (15 of 42) of lesions showed residual LM on staged excisions. Pretreating LM with imiquimod, 5%, cream may decrease surgical defect sizes; however, total reliance on topical imiquimod as an alternative to surgery may put the patient at increased risk of a local recurrence.

We set an in vitro system able to detect fona fide in vivo primed CD4+ T cells. Purified CD4+ T cells are first stimulated in vitro once in the presence peptides, previously identified as containing naturally processed epitopes on tumour-associated antigens. After two weeks, proliferation and cytokine secretion (IFN-?, IL-5, IL-4, IL-2, TNF-?, IL-10, TGF-?, IL-17, granzyme and perforin) are tested. To estimate the frequency of antigen specific CD4+ T cell we used intracellular staining for IFN-? and/or IL-13, following indications from restimulation assays. We investigated the spontaneous CD4+ T cell immunity to MAGE-A3 and CEA in normal donors and in patients with advanced melanoma and pancreas carcinoma, respectively. We found that MAGE-A3 specific CD4+ T cells, which showed an unpolarized or Th2 skewed phenotype, were present in the blood of a high percentage of melanoma patients. We also found that pancreatic cancer patients compared to normal donors have impaired quantitative (i.e., reduced number of responders) and qualitative (i.e., Th2 skew) anti-CEA CD4+ T cell response. Importantly, anti-viral CD4+ T immunity was preserved. These results suggest that local more than systemic immunoregulatory mechanisms are active in pancreatic cancer. We have optimized the MAGE-A3 peptides to load onto HLA-DR*1101 tetramers by generating minimal peptide analogues containing a single anchor residue and we succeeded to produce functional HLA-DR*1101 tetramers.

We plan to continue the monitoring of vaccine and tumour specific T cell responses in vaccinated melanoma patients and the spontaneous anti-tumour CD4+ T cell immunity in patients with MAGE-A3, CEA and HPV expressing neoplastic lesions by the use of the strategies developed inclusive of the HLA-DR*1101 tetramers.""" ;

Using CX3CR1GFP mice, in which bmDC are green fluorescent (GFP), the bmDC localization was analyzed and it was found that the cells were organized in unique clusters, mainly located in the endosteum of the BM. These DC co-localize with B cells and these clusters are occupying architecturally definable niches and are reminiscent to the niches that were found in the cranial BM parenchyma. By using Fibronectin antibody the stroma of the BM could be visualized. In addition, a large fraction of IgA positive plasma cells is located in the BM. Staining for these cells revealed that plasma cells are scattered through the BM and are not preferentially found in DC-B cell niche. However, depletion of DC led to reduction in IgA+ plasma cells, which might indicate that bmDC are critical for survival of these cells in the BM. " ;

      dc:description "Integrins are a family of heterodimeric glycoproteins on cell surfaces that mediate diverse biological events involving cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions (1). Integrins consist of an α and a β subunit and are important for cell adhesion and signal transduction. The αvβ3 integrin is the most prominent receptor affecting tumor growth, tumor invasiveness, metastasis, tumor-induced angiogenesis, inflammation, osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (2-7). Expression of the αvβ3 integrin is strong on tumor cells and activated endothelial cells, whereas expression is weak on resting endothelial cells and most normal tissues. The αvβ3 antagonists are being studied as antitumor and antiangiogenic agents and the agonists are being studied as angiogenic agents for coronary angiogenesis (6, 8, 9). The peptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) has been identified as a recognition motif used by extracellular matrix proteins (vitronectin, fibrinogen, laminin, and collagen) to bind to a variety of integrins, including αvβ3. Various radiolabeled antagonists have been introduced for imaging of tumors and tumor angiogenesis (10). Most of the cyclic RGD peptides are composed of five amino acids. Various cyclic RGD peptides exhibit selective inhibition of binding to αvβ3 (50% inhibition concentration (IC50), 7–40 nM) but not to αvβ5 (IC50, 600–4,000 nM) or αIIbβ3 (IC50, 700–5,000 nM) integrins (11). Various radiolabeled cyclic RGD peptides and peptidomimetics have been found to have high accumulation in tumors in mice (12, 13). From these developments, [18F]galacto-c(RGDfK) has been evaluated in a number of clinical studies for imaging of αvβ3 in cancer patients (14-18). Knetsch et al. (19) reported the development of 68Ga-1,4,7-triazacyclononane,1-glutaric acid-4,7-acetic acid-cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Lys) (68Ga-NODAGA-c(RGDfK)) for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of αvβ3 receptors in nude mice bearing melanoma tumors. 1-(1-Carboxy-3-carbo-tert-butoxypropyl)-4,7-(carbo-tert-butoxymethyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane (NODAGA(tBu)3) was used to prepare 68Ga-NODAGA-c(RGDfK). Dumont et al. (20) chelated NODAGA-c(RGDfK) with 64Cu to form 64Cu-NODAGA-c(RGDfK) for PET imaging of αvβ3 receptors in nude mice bearing human glioblastoma tumors." ;

TLRs signal directly for DC activation but also promote production of immunomodulatory mediators by many other cell types. These mediators could be sufficient to activate DC indirectly, thereby potentially allowing responses to organisms with which DC do not come into direct contact. 

We tested this hypothesis and, surprisingly, found that indirect signals alone led only to partial DC activation and resulted in clonal expansion of T cells lacking typical Th1 or Th2 function. These results show that indirect signals by themselves cannot fully substitute for TLR triggering in DC and further suggest that the function of TLRs and other pattern recognition receptors expressed by APC is to regulate production of Th-directing cytokines, allowing APC to couple the class of adaptive immune response to the nature of the pathogen. This has important implication for the design of cancer vaccines and is of direct relevance to the goals of the network.""" ;

We found that CyP acts as a potent and selective antagonist of bacterial LPS. CyP did not induce any detectable response in human DCs and competitively inhibited LPS binding to the extracellular domain of TLR4. Addition of CyP together with LPS completely inhibited both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways and suppressed the whole LPS-induced gene transcription program. CyP was effective in protecting mice from endotoxin shock in spite of a lower capacity to inhibit LPS stimulation of mouse DCs.  Remarkably, delayed addition of CyP to DCs responding to LPS strongly inhibited signaling and cytokine production by immediate down-regulation of inflammatory cytokine mRNAs, while not affecting other aspects of DC maturation such as expression of MHC, costimulatory molecules and CCR7. These results open promising perspectives for the use of CyP as a therapeutic agent able to modulate innate and adaptive immune responses and reveal the requirement of sustained TLR4 stimulation for induction of cytokine gene expression in human DCs." ;

Whereas anti-vaccine CTL were rare in the blood and inside metastases of this patient, anti-tumor CTL recognizing other tumor Ags, mainly MAGE-C2, were 100 times more frequent in the blood and considerably enriched in metastases following vaccination. In this study we report the analysis of the CTL response of a second melanoma patient who showed a mixed tumor response after vaccination with dendritic cells pulsed with two MAGE-A3 antigenic peptides presented, respectively, by HLA-A1 and HLA-DP4. Anti-MAGE-3.A1 CD8 and anti-MAGE-3.DP4 CD4 T cells became detectable in the blood after vaccination at a frequency of approximately 10(-5) among the CD8 or CD4 T cells, respectively, and they were slightly enriched in slowly progressing metastases. Additional anti-tumor CTL were present in the blood at a frequency of 2x10(-4) among the CD8 T cells and, among these, an anti-MAGE-C2 CTL clone was detected only following vaccination and was enriched by >1,000-fold in metastases relative to the blood. The striking similarity of these results with our previous observations further supports the hypothesis that the induction of a few anti-vaccine T cells may prime or restimulate additional anti-tumor T cell clones that are mainly responsible for the tumor regression." ;

Data has been obtained on the  cellular organization of the marrow of long bones.

The bone marrow (BM) is a primary lymphoid organ, where diverse hematopoietic lineages arise from common multi-potential progenitors [1]. However, aside from this established role in hematopoiesis, the BM also serves as secondary lymphoid organ in the generation of adaptive T and B cell immune responses [2,3]. It has been shown that the BM is also populated by mature lymphocytes, which home to the BM and seem to inhabit specific niches [2,4]. Two photon microscopic analysis of mouse skull BM revealed that the BM-resident Dendritic cells (bmDC) in the cranial BM parenchyma are organized in unique peri-vascular clusters tightly wrapped around distinct BM blood vessels and occupying architecturally definable niches. Interestingly, these clusters are reminiscent of recently reported peri-sinusoidal niches that are defined by mature re-circulating B cells [2]. We showed that grafted B and T cells efficiently homed to the BM and their distribution was restricted to the extra-vascular areas covered by bmDC. Using a conditional in vivo DC ablation system, we analyzed the BM and periphery of DC-depleted mice and found that bmDC ablation led to a profound B cell reduction. The effect was specific to the BM, since the frequencies of B cells in the spleen and lymph nodes were not impaired. Moreover, the reduction was specific for recirculating mature B cell compartment, whereas B cell development was unaffected by bmDC ablation. This phenotype could be reverted by B cell over-expression of the anti-apoptotic factor bcl2. Moreover, we showed that re-circulating B cell survival requires the presence of bmDC, which produce macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in the perivascular BM niches [5]. 

The aim of my visit at the Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ) and the laboratory of Prof. Andreas Radbruch was to study the organization of bmDC, B lymphocytes and plasma cells in the BM of the long bones by immunochistochemistry. During my visit I learned the preparation of the bones for histology, crysectioning, immunohistochemistry and analysis of the stained sections by confocal microscope.
Using a CX3CR1GFP mice, in which bmDC are green fluorescent (GFP), I analyzed the bmDC localization and found the the cells organized in unique clusters, mainly located in the endosteum of the BM. These DC co-localize with B cells and these clusters are occupying architecturally definable niches and are reminiscent to the niches that were found in the cranial BM parenchyma. By using Fibronectin antibody I could visualize the stroma of the BM. In addition, a large fraction of IgA positive plasma cells is located in the BM. Staining for these cells revealed that plasma cells are scattered through the BM and are not preferentially found in DC-B cell niche. However, depletion of DC led to reduction in IgA+ plasma cells, which might indicate that bmDC are critical for survival of these cells in the BM. Thus, additional experiments will be conducted in order to understand the interactions between bmDC and plasma cells.

For this purpose, the model antigen OVA was fused to the C1C2 exosome-binding domain of MFG-E8/lactadherin. Tumors secreting the exosome-bound antigen grow slower than tumors secreting soluble OVA, because they induce activation of OVA-specific CD8+ T cells into killer cells. In addition, inducing in vivo secretion of the C1C2-coupled antigen by DNA vaccination induces prevention against subsequent tumor growth. These results show for the first time a function for exosome secretion in vivo. A paper describing these results has been published in 2008 (Zeelenberg et al., Cancer Research).
Our goal is now to develop the C1C2-based DNA vaccination approach to obtain an efficient anti-tumor therapeutic vaccine in mouse models. In parallel, we are analysing the mechanisms of exosome secretion in vitro. The goal of this project is to identify tools to inhibit or increase exosome secretion in vivo, and thus decipher their physiological roles, as well as modulate exosome-dependent immune responses.""" ;

Institute for Medical Research (IMR), the only Yugoslav governmental research institute in the field of biomedicine, was founded 58 years ago by the Serbian Academy of Science. From the beginning the main orientation of IMR was directed towards basic and applied investigations in several different fields. Today, IMR comprises more than 45 researchers (medical doctors, biologists, molecular biologists, chemists, pharmacists, biochemists etc.) organized in seven research units. The overall bibliography of IMR amounts to over 2.000 original papers, published mainly in international scientific journals. IMR researchers have also edited ten published scientific books. """ ;

A seed contribution of £2.5 million from the Darwin Trust was followed by financial commitments from The Wolfson Foundation, the University and the Wellcome Trust, allowing construction of the Michael Swann Building. The majority of research space was earmarked for Wellcome Trust-funded research. Recruitment, based on research excellence at all levels in the area of cell biology, began in earnest in 1993, mostly but not exclusively, through the award of Research Fellowships from the Wellcome Trust. The Swann Building was first occupied by new arrivals in January 1996 and became “The Welcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology” from October 2001." ;

We initially performed experiments to evaluate zymoliase sensitivity of asci for this specific strain and we assessed that 15 minutes incubation was the minimum time needed to damage the ascus, without touching the spore cell wall. Zymoliase was inactivated by heat (65°C for 2 minutes) and washed away carefully together with the remainings of the empty ascus, by resuspending twice the spore culture in 500 µl of distilled water centrifuging and discarding the supernatant; the spores were then resuspended to a concentration of 108 cells/ml. In order to exclude damage on the spore cell wall or effects on spore viability 100 µl of a culture of 1000 spores per ml was plated on YPD in triplicate, the spores showed 100% viability." ;

The receptor-ligand pair P-selectin and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) are critically involved in this process. In this study, we examined the expression of functional PSGL-1 on bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors. We demonstrate that functional PSGL-1 is expressed at low levels on hematopoietic stem cells, but upregulated on the cell surface of progenitors that bear other homing molecules known to be important for thymic settling. We found that progenitors able to home to the thymus expressed high levels of PSGL-1 transcripts compared with hematopoietic stem cells. We further demonstrate that hematopoietic progenitors lacking fucosyltransferase 4 and 7 do not express functional PSGL-1, and do not home efficiently to the thymus. These studies provide insight into the developmentally regulated expression of a critical determinant involved in progenitor homing to the thymus." ;

      dc:description "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Nimesulide, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, on the growth of hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells (FaDu) in vitro, and investigate its potential mechanism. METHODS: After FaDu cells were treated with graded concentrations of Nimesulide for divergent time, sensitivity of cells to drug treatment was analyzed by MTT assay. Morphological changes of FaDu cells in the presence of Nimesulide were observed by acridine orange cytochemistry staining. Proliferating cells were detected using the 5-Bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) incorporation assay. Following cells were subjected to Nimesulide (500 mumol/l) for 6 h, 12 h and 24 h, the percentage of apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. We detected COX-2 and Survivin expression change by RT-PCR and Western blot, and analyzed the correlation of them with the growth of FaDu cells. Additionally, we also analyzed Caspase-3, Bcl-2 and Bax expressions as markers to investigate the related pathway of Nimesulide-indued apoptosis. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the viabilities rates were decreased by Nimesulide in time- and dose-dependent manners, typical morphological changes of apoptotic cells were observed in the Nimesulide-treatment groups, Nimesulide could suppress the proliferation of FaDu cells significantly. The percentage of apoptosis in FaDu cells were markedly increased after Nimesulide-treatment for 6 h, 12 h and 24 h. Nimesulide down-regulated the Survivin and COX-2 expressions at mRNA and protein levels in FaDu cells. Additional analyses indicated that Bcl-2 expression was significantly decreased and the expressions of Caspase-3 as well as Bax were increased at both mRNA and protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the induction of apoptosis and suppression of proliferation, Nimesulide could inhibit the growth of FaDu cells. Furthermore, the suppression of Survivin expression may play an important role in Nimesulide-induced growth inhibition. Nimesulide could act as an effective therapeutic agent for hypopharyngeal carcinoma therapy." ;

      rdfs:comment """We obtained data on the influence of bLf, whose immunomodulant properties are now recognized, on  MDDC differentiation/activation. We found that bLF interferes with the activation of MD-DC induced by different TLR agonists, but not by T cell mediated signals. Although bLF did not significantly influence monocyte differentiation in DCs, we found that it markedly reduced the up-modulation of CD83, co-stimulatory and MHC molecules (i.e. CD80, CD86, MHC class I and II), and cytokine secretion (IL-12, TNF-? and IL-23) induced by LPS or polyI-C. Consistently with an impaired MDDC maturation, bLF exposed cells retained antigen uptake capacity and exhibited a lower capacity to promote T cell proliferation and Th1 polarization. Although bLF did not affect the phenotype of R848 activated MDDC, these cells exhibited a reduced capacity to produce IL-12 and TNF-? and to promote Th1 polarization, and retained antigen uptake capacity. In contrast, no major effects on the phenotypic and functional properties of CD40L activated MD-DCs were observed in the presence of bLF. Overall, these results provide evidence for an antinflammatory role of bLF in the modulation of MDDC function, independently of its capacity to bind LPS (Puddu et al.). Of note, human recombinant Lf (Talactoferrin) has been shown to exhibit different effects on human MDDC, since exposure of these cells to talactoferrin provides an activation stimulus leading to enhanced Th1 responses and production of effector cytokines. These different effects are likely due to the recognition of different receptors, expressed in MDDC by talactoferrin and bLf.

Future studies will focus on: 
(1a)  investigating bLf effects on DC activation  triggered by TLR agonists in terms of:
   i) migratory capacity, 
   ii) chemokine receptors expression (CCR5 versus CCR7), 
   iii) chemokine secretion; 
(1b) characterizing mechanisms underlying the capacity of bLf to attenuate inflammation and to define whether this property is linked to its function in the regulation of iron homeostasis; 
(1c) analysis of the cellular determinants involved in the interaction of MDDC with bLf as well as of their role in mediating the antinflammatory activity of bLf.""" ;

We focused on the study of the response of MDDCs to the combined stimulation with TLR ligands and we observed that simultaneous activation of TLR4 and TLR8 signaling cascades results in a marked inhibition of the secretion of the proinflammatory chemokine CCL2 with respect to stimulation through a single TLR. This inhibition is specific for both CCL2 and TLR agonist combination and could represent a novel regulatory mechanism evolved to maintain immunological balance (Del Cornò et al.).

Future studies will focus on 
- characterizing the mechanism(s) by which cross-tolerance between TLRs induce different functional states of DCs that favour different T cell effector phenotypes. Moreover, a further characterization of the molecular mechanisms underlying CCL2 regulation, will be also performed;

This methodoly incorporates a unique sample preparation procedure based on 96 well plate complex sample trypsinization, a nano-LC-based peptide separation coupled to MSMS analysis sequencing. This procedure led us to the identification of 600 phagosomal proteins from murine DC phagosomes. An integrated software solution has been developed to analyse these results and to perform comparative analysis of phagosome proteomes obtained in various conditions. 

This methodology has been applied successfully to identify: 

a) a set of proteins specifically associated to phagosomes in DCs but not other phagocytes, such as macrophages,

While standard formats and software systems have been developed to represent and publicly share information about microarray experiments, existing computational solutions give limited support to the representation of the outcomes, experimental hypotheses or conclusions about biological questions that are dealt with in gene expression analysis. We propose an OWL-based model and a Semantic Web-based approach to address the issue. We show that the formalization of microarray-related knowledge has the potential to enhance the access and the sharing of gene expression data; it promotes the collaboration on analysing them and, in general, it can improve the achievements of the scientific community working in the field.

Co-cultures of IFN-DCs with zoledronate-stimulated gamma delta T lymphocytes were also performed. gamma delta T-cell activation, as demonstrated by their up-modulation of activation marker expression levels (e.g. CD25 and CD69), was observed. These studies demonstrated for the first time the existence of a bidirectional activating interaction between DCs and gamma delta T lymphocytes activated by aminobiphosphonates. These data suggest a potential adjuvant role of this early cross-talk in the therapeutic activity of aminobiphosphonate drug that are currently used as anti-tumor drugs. A further characterization of the functional activities of activated gamma delta T lymphocytes and the reciprocal activation of the IFN-DCs are currently in progress. 

In the context of a different research project, it was observed that GM-CSF can promote, in the absence of any other stimulus, the differentiation of human monocytes into dendritic cells. These GM-DCs are endowed with distinct immuno-stimulatory and migratory properties. In particular, GM-DCs are activated CD1a+ DCs expressing co-stimulatory molecules, MHC class I and II, able to induce the proliferation and IFN-gamma production of allogeneic T lymphocytes and to *migrate toward both inflammatory and homeostatic chemokines. Interestingly the responsiveness of individual donors to this DC-differentiation promoting activity of GM-CSF positively correlates with their basal expression level of GM-CSF receptor.

The results have been accepted for publication (Conti et al., EJI). The detailed protocol might be submitted to the knowledge portal.""" ;

Finally, a LaTEX document is dynamically generated depending on the performed analysis steps. The generated report contains comments and analysis results as well as the references to several files for a deeper investigation.

Because the cells cannot synthesize these amino acids, after some generations all proteins are labelled and therefore can be distinguished and quantified by the mass spectrometer. To generate a proteomic map of DCs which includes quantitative information that can be used further to study signalling cascades it is also necessary to optimize the SILAC labelling of DCs.

      dc:description "Integrins are a family of heterodimeric glycoproteins on cell surfaces that mediate diverse biological events involving cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions (1). Integrins consist of an α and a β subunit and are important for cell adhesion and signal transduction. The αvβ3 integrin is the most prominent receptor affecting tumor growth, tumor invasiveness, metastasis, tumor-induced angiogenesis, inflammation, osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (2-7). Expression of the αvβ3 integrin is strong on tumor cells and activated endothelial cells, whereas expression is weak on resting endothelial cells and most normal tissues. The αvβ3 antagonists are being studied as antitumor and antiangiogenic agents and the agonists are being studied as angiogenic agents for coronary angiogenesis (6, 8, 9). The peptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) has been identified as a recognition motif used by extracellular matrix proteins (vitronectin, fibrinogen, laminin, and collagen) to bind to a variety of integrins, including αvβ3. Various radiolabeled antagonists have been introduced for imaging of tumors and tumor angiogenesis (10). Most of the cyclic RGD peptides are composed of five amino acids. Various cyclic RGD peptides exhibit selective inhibition of binding to αvβ3 (50% inhibition concentration (IC50), 7–40 nM) but not to αvβ5 (IC50, 600–4,000 nM) or αIIbβ3 (IC50, 700–5,000 nM) integrins (11). Various radiolabeled cyclic RGD peptides and peptidomimetics have been found to have high accumulation in tumors in mice (12, 13). From these developments, [18F]galacto-c(RGDfK) has been evaluated in a number of clinical studies for imaging of αvβ3 in cancer patients (14-18). Knetsch et al. (19) reported the development of 68Ga-1,4,7-triazacyclononane,1-glutaric acid-4,7-acetic acid-cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Lys) (68Ga-NODAGA-c(RGDfK)) for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of αvβ3 receptors in nude mice bearing melanoma tumors. 1-(1-Carboxy-3-carbo-tert-butoxypropyl)-4,7-(carbo-tert-butoxymethyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane (NODAGA(tBu)3) was used to prepare 68Ga-NODAGA-c(RGDfK). Dumont et al. (20) chelated NODAGA-c(RGDfK) with 64Cu to form 64Cu-NODAGA-c(RGDfK) for PET imaging of αvβ3 receptors in nude mice bearing human glioblastoma tumors. For evaluation as a PET imaging agent for αvβ3, 64Cu has been attached to c(RGDfK) via bis(carboxymethyl)-1,4,8,11-tetraazabicyclo[6.6.2]hexadecane (CB-TE2A) to form 64Cu-CB-TE2A-c(RGDfK). The CB-TE2A chelating agent is thought to be a more stable chelate for Cu." ;

Sclerosing Sertoli cell tumor is a rare sex cord stromal tumor variant, with 16 cases reported in the English literature. We present an unusual case of sclerosing Sertoli cell tumor in a 33-year-old Caucasian male, which was negative or weakly reactive using immunohistochemical markers typically positive in Sertoli cell tumors. The tumor was positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, CAM 5.2, vimentin, CD56, CK8, synaptophysin and S100, and negative for inhibin, calretinin, WT1, CD99, CD117, CK5/6, CK7, chromogranin A, placental alkaline phosphatase, neuron specific enolase, D2-40, smooth muscle actin, Melan-A, epithelial membrane antigen and carbonic anhydrase IX. This is the second reported case of a Sertoli cell tumor with reactivity limited to neuroendocrine markers and the first such case of the sclerosing variant. A literature review of sclerosing Sertoli cell tumor, including English and non-English literature, is described. Our case highlights that expected immunohistochemical markers may be negative, and awareness of antigenically unreactive tumors is needed to avoid confusion between Sertoli cell tumor and other entities." ;

The functional avidities of these CTL clones, evaluated in lysis assays, were surprisingly low, suggesting that high avidity was not part of the putative capability of these CTL to trigger tumor rejection. Most anti-MAGE-3.A1 CTL clones obtained after DC vaccination, but not after peptide or ALVAC vaccination, produced IL-10. Transcript profiling confirmed this result and indicated that about 20 genes, including CD40L, prostaglandin D2 synthase, granzyme K and granzyme H, were differentially expressed between the anti-MAGE-3.A1 CTL clones derived from patients vaccinated with peptide-ALVAC or with peptide-pulsed DC. These results indicate that the modality of vaccination with a tumor-specific antigen influences the differentiation pathway of the anti-vaccine CD8 T cells, which may have an impact on their capacity to trigger a tumor rejection response.""" ;

With its 17 faculties, institutes and research centers, it offers a wide range of teaching and conducts academic research in all major scientific disciplines. Biomedical sciences are among the most prominent research areas of UNIGE. For the management of European research projects and fellowships, UNIGE has set-up a European grants office (http://www.unige.ch/recherche/euresearch/index.html) working closely together with specialized accounting, legal and human resource support services.
The Faculty of Medicine is the second largest faculty of UNIGE. It is closely partnered with the University Hospital of Geneva (http://www.hug-ge.ch/) and consists of three sections, Fundamental Medicine, Clinical Medicine and Dental Medicine. The section of Fundamental Medicine comprises six departments focussing on research themes that have been attributed high priorities by the Faculty of Medicine on the basis of academic excellence and an outstanding scientific track record. The Department of Pathology and Immunology comprises 10 basic research teams and 5 affiliated groups from the section of Clinical Medicine. The majority of these groups concentrate on research in the fields of immunology and immunopathology.
To promote excellence in cutting-edge research, the Faculty of Medicine has made a major investment in the establishment and maintenance of numerous state-of-the-art core facilities. The latter notably include facilities that are directly relevant to research performed in DC-THERA (genomics, proteomics, high-throughput sequencing, animal housing, generation of genetically modified mice, flow-cytometry). 
The laboratory of Walter Reith has a longstanding interest and expertise in the transcriptional regulation of gene expression in cells of the immune system, with a particular accent on human and mouse antigen presenting cells, including B lymphocytes, macrophages and DCs. Experimental strategies applied routinely in his laboratory encompass standard molecular, biochemical and cellular techniques for analyzing transcriptional and post-transcriptional control mechanisms, the generation of transgenic and knockout mice to study the functional consequences of perturbing specific regulatory pathways in vivo, and high-throughput technologies for characterizing regulatory networks, including microarray gene expression profiling, and genome-wide ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq methods for study transcription factor binding and epigenetic chromatin modifications.""" ;

      dc:description "Ectopic sphenoid sinus pituitary adenoma (ESSPA) may arise from a remnant of Rathke's pouch. These tumors are frequently misdiagnosed as other neuroendocrine or epithelial neoplasms which may develop in this site (olfactory neuroblastoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma, paraganglioma, melanoma). Thirty-two patients with ESSPA identified in patients with normal pituitary glands (intact sella turcica) were retrospectively retrieved from the consultation files of the authors' institutions. Clinical records were reviewed with follow-up obtained. An immunohistochemical panel was performed on available material. Sixteen males and 16 females, aged 2-84 years (mean, 57.1 years), presented with chronic sinusitis, headache, obstructive symptoms, and visual field defects, although several were asymptomatic (n = 6). By definition, the tumors were centered within the sphenoid sinus and demonstrated, by imaging studies or intraoperative examination, a normal sella turcica without a concurrent pituitary adenoma. A subset of tumors showed extension into the nasal cavity (n = 5) or nasopharynx (n = 9). Mean tumor size was 3.4 cm. The majority of tumors were beneath an intact respiratory epithelium (n = 22), arranged in many different patterns (solid, packets, organoid, pseudorosette-rosette, pseudopapillary, single file, glandular, trabecular, insular). Bone involvement was frequently seen (n = 21). Secretions were present (n = 16). Necrosis was noted in 8 tumors. The tumors showed a variable cellularity, with polygonal, plasmacytoid, granular, and oncocytic tumor cells. Severe pleomorphism was uncommon (n = 5). A delicate, salt-and-pepper chromatin distribution was seen. In addition, there were intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions (n = 25) and multinucleated tumor cells (n = 18). Mitotic figures were infrequent, with a mean of 1 per 10 HPFs and a <1% proliferation index (Ki-67). There was a vascularized to sclerotic or calcified stroma. Immunohistochemistry highlighted the endocrine nature of the tumors, with synaptophysin (97%), CD56 (91%), NSE (76%) and chromogranin (71%); while pan-cytokeratin was positive in 79%, frequently with a dot-like Golgi accentuation (50%). Reactivity with pituitary hormones included 48% reactive for 2 or more hormones (plurihormonal), and 33% reactive for a single hormone, with prolactin seen most frequently (59%); 19% of cases were non-reactive. The principle differential diagnosis includes olfactory neuroblastoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, melanoma, and meningioma. All patients were treated with surgery. No patients died from disease, although one patient died with persistent disease (0.8 months). Surgery is curative in the majority of cases, although recurrence/persistence was seen in 4 patients (13.8%). In conclusion, ESSPAs are rare, affecting middle aged patients with non-specific symptoms, showing characteristic light microscopy and immunohistochemical features of their intrasellar counterparts. When encountering a tumor within the sphenoid sinus, ectopic pituitary adenoma must be considered, and pertinent imaging, clinical, and immunohistochemical evaluation undertaken to exclude tumors within the differential diagnosis. This will result in accurate classification, helping to prevent the potentially untoward side effects or complications of incorrect therapy." ;

MAPU contains several body fluid proteomes; including plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. Cell lines have been mapped to a depth of several thousand proteins and the red blood cell proteome has also been analyzed in depth. The liver proteome is represented with 3200 proteins. By employing high resolution MS and stringent validation criteria, false positive identification rates in MAPU are lower than 1:1000. Thus MAPU datasets can serve as reference proteomes in biomarker discovery. MAPU contains the peptides identifying each protein, measured masses, scores and intensities using a clickable interface of cell or body parts. Proteome data can be queried across proteomes by protein name, accession number, sequence similarity, peptide sequence and annotation information. More than 4500 mouse and 2500 human proteins have already been identified in at least one proteome. 	

Basic annotation information and links to other public databases are provided in MAPU and we plan to add further analysis tools.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """The Challenge of Cancer: Individual Cancers and Mutations

Every individual´s cancer is unique. Therefore, the most effective treatment is one customized to a particular cancer´s genetic configuration. Genetic mutations and chromosomal abnormalities are commonly associated with human cancers. Unfortunately, since the genetic mutations leading to the development of cancer are often random events, every patient's tumor can contain a unique repertoire of antigens. This characteristic of human cancer requires that each patient's immune system be able to recognize and target the specific antigens present.

To address the challenge of the unique genetic profile of each cancer and the genetic mutations of that cancer, Argos' Arcelis personalized immunotherapy technology for cancer captures the complete, unique genetic information of individual tumors, loads a patient's own dendritic cells with the total tumor RNA and uses these dendritic cells to trigger an appropriate immune response. The Arcelis iummnotherapy for cancer, is therefore, customized to the unique antigenic repertoire of each patient's tumor, equipping the immune system to recognize and fight that particular disease. This approach precludes the need to identify or isolate specific tumor antigens and enables targeting of unknown tumor antigens and treatment of patients from whom only a minute amount of tumor material can be obtained.

Creating a Personalized Cancer Product
Argos’ Arcelis immunotherapy for cancer starts with precursors of the patient's dendritic cells, which, when matured for the immunotherapeutic, are currently considered the most effective antigen-presenting cells within the immune system. Argos amplifies whole tumor RNA from each individual patient (whether from the primary tumor site, distant metastatic sites or from tumor cells present in circulation) and then transfects the same patient's dendritic cells with the patient's tumor RNA. This process offers the opportunity for most cancer types at any stage of disease to be target opportunities for the Company's cancer immunotherapy approach.

Unique Advantages
- Dendritic cells transfected with RNA-encoding tumor antigens have been shown to stimulate potent immune cell responses equal or superior to other competing approaches
- The Arcelis immunotherapeutic is completely autologous (derived from the patient’s body), potentially offering maximum safety with minimal side effects
- The Arcelis immunotherapeutic targets the entire antigenic repertoire of the tumor including ‘private mutations’ unique to that patient
- A single production run makes enough product to continuously treat the patient for several years
Production requires only a minute tumor specimen, allowing treatment both of earlier stage and later stage patients 
- Argos´ centralized, automated manufacturing process is optimized for ‘day-old’ monocytes, allowing for production that provides the flexibility to access patients and clinical sites nationwide 
- Formulation requires no specialized manipulation at the clinical sites, maximizing site participation (thaw in vial, load syringe, inject)

HIV & OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES
Chronic viral infections, such as those caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), are difficult to treat and often incurable. Argos is applying its Arcelis technology platform to transfect dendritic cells with patients’ own viral RNA antigens, promoting immune responses perfectly matched to the patient’s unique viral variants.

The Arcelis HIV process utilizes small plasma samples from infected patients to amplify large quantities of messenger RNA that encode selected viral antigens. This technique has the added advantage of amplifying the multitude of patient-specific viral variants evolving in the infected patient, allowing for the creation of a therapy perfectly suited to the individual. Therefore, the viral sequences presented to the immune system to recognize and attack are completely compatible with the virus that has infected the host. The simultaneous presence of autologous viral sequences and dendritic cells should result in a novel immune response, personalized to each patient, that potentially has a greater probability of success in controlling residual virus or a rebound of virus following the cessation of therapy.

Studies published in Nature Medicine and The Journal of Infectious Diseases have demonstrated how patient-specific immunotherapeutic approaches similar to Argos´ have the potential to be effective treatment for people with chronic HIV infection. Additionally, a Phase 1 trial of Argos´ HIV candidate AGS-004, presented at the 2008 International AIDS conference, demonstrated that AGS-004 achieved the trial´s primary endpoint of induction of T cells response to patient-specific HIV antigens. Click here

In October 2006, Argos was awarded a $21M National Institutes of Health (NIH) contract to develop its Arcelis HIV immunotherapy platform. In addition to determining the immunogenicity of the Arcelis HIV product currently in the clinic, the goal of the five-year contract is to subsequently develop then test in the clinic even more potent next generation product candidates.

Argos believes its Arcelis technology can also be used to create immunotherapies for other chronic infectious diseases that don’t respond to current treatments. Infections such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and herpes represent some of the largest and most significant areas of unmet medical need. In fact, any disease subject to immune surveillance is potentially addressable.

Unique Advantages
- The Arcelis immunotherapeutic can be comprised of any number of strategically selected viral antigens (chosen to not adversely affect the biology of dendritic cells) 
- Amplification of viral antigens includes patient-specific dominant and quasispecies (important for highly mutagenic viruses such as HIV and HCV) 
- Immune responses generated are 100% relevant for that patient 
- Production requires only a small plasma sample that can be obtained during leukapheresis 
- If virus escape occurs at some point post-treatment, the product can be ‘updated’ using a new plasma sample 
- Argos knows of no other dendritic cell-based technology that could feasibly produce an autologous anti-viral immunotherapeutic""" ;

Despite the significant advances in mass spectrometry, which has enabled much of proteomics, due to various analytical challenges so far no eukaryotic total cell proteome has been sequenced completely. An alternative approach is to purify single organelles or DC components in order to generate the proteomic data.

An additional problem is to obtain highly pure fractions of DC from crude population of untouched splenic cells with a purity of 70-80%. This includes several sophisticated steps for depletion of all unwanted cell types. The crude population of DC is divided into the three known splenic subsets (CD8+, CD4+, DN DC) using Fluorescence activated cell sorting (BD FACS Aria). This procedure allowed to obtain highly pure fractions of each subset. However, because DC are a very rare population, this method is very material- and cost-intensive. Furthermore, it is not surprising that the obtained cell numbers of each subset after isolation are below 107. However, these cell numbers should be sufficient for proteomic investigations. The proteomes of all three subsets using mass spectrometry is in progress.""" ;

      dc:description "Dendritic cells (DC) are the most potent antigen presenting cells and have proven effective in stimulation of specific immune responses in vivo. Competing immune inhibition could limit the clinical efficacy of DC vaccination. In this phase II trial, metronomic Cyclophosphamide and a Cox-2 inhibitor have been added to a DC vaccine with the intend to dampen immunosuppressive mechanisms. Twenty-eight patients with progressive metastatic melanoma were treated with autologous DCs pulsed with survivin, hTERT, and p53-derived peptides (HLA-A2(+)) or tumor lysate (HLA-A2(-)). Concomitantly the patients were treated with IL-2, Cyclophosphamide, and Celecoxib. The treatment was safe and tolerable. Sixteen patients (57 %) achieved stable disease (SD) at 1st evaluation and 8 patients had prolonged SD (7-13.7 months). The median OS was 9.4 months. Patients with SD had an OS of 10.5 months while patients with progressive disease (PD) had an OS of 6.0 months (p = 0.048) even though there were no differences in prognostic factors between the two groups. Despite the use of metronomic Cyclophosphamide, regulatory T cells did not decrease during treatment. Indirect IFN-γ ELISPOT assays showed a general increase in immune responses from baseline to the time of 4th vaccination. Induction of antigen-specific immune responses was seen in 9 out of 15 screened HLA-A2(+) patients. In conclusion, the number of patients obtaining SD more than doubled and 6-month survival significantly increased compared to a previous trial without Cyclophosphamide and Celecoxib. A general increase in immune responses against the tested peptides was observed." ;

D1 cells will be stimulated with LPS and harvested at different time-points for GeneChip analysis and for tandem mass spectrometry-based analysis of the integral plasma membrane proteome. A protocol for obtaining highly pure integral membrane proteins has already been set up in the last two months in the lab of Paola Castagnoli in collaboration with the lab of Juri Rappsilber at IFOM. 

A pilot project has already been performed on untreated D1 cells and on D1 cells matured for 24 hours with LPS. The two protein sample are currently being analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry by the lab of Juri Rappsilber. Data will be compared with previously collected microarray data. 

From a purely immunological perspective, we will identify new genes that change their expression at the cell surface during DC maturation, that may serve as novel maturation markers or that may tell us something new about DC maturation. From a more systems biology perspective, we will determine the amount of correlation between transcriptome and proteome dynamic changes and reconstruct the first transcript-protein network of DC maturation.""" ;

Following the extensive proteomic analysis of immature and mature DC-derived exosomes, ICAM-1 was identified as the major protein on mature DC-derived exosomes, required for their functional activity. In order to functionally validate the proteomic data, the antigen-presenting function has been investigated. Exosomes bearing functional MHC-peptide complexes have been shown to be presented at the surface of recipient DCs as intact \"antigen-presenting microdomains\", without the need for internalisation and reprocessing by the DC. It has been shown that DCs express specific receptors for exosomes. Since ICAM-1 on exosomes is required for their ability to activate T cells via DCs in vitro, the role of Mac-1 and LFA-1 (the major ligands for ICAM-1) as potential receptors for exosomes has been investigated. A new role for LFA-1 on DCs as a receptor for exosomes has been proposed. " ;

      rdfs:comment """Our group has MRI data available on the migration of DCs in vivo in melanoma patients. From isolated lymphnodes obtained after surgery we could identify single DC after staining with Prussian blue for iron. We are in the process of analysing the T cell rosettes (activation stage) that surround these DC to get insight in the functional activity. 
It was also demonstrated that DCs transfected with RNA produce derived proteins in vivo in the lymph nodes.

Also efforts were spent to get further information on the dynamics of immature and mature DCs. We discovered (van Helden et al JI 2006) that podosomes are present in immature DCs but absent on highly migratory mature monocytes derived DCs. Interestingly, PGE2 treatment almost instantaneously resulted in the resolution of the podosomes, indicating that PGE2 mediated signalling is one of the earliest steps to induce a more migratory phenotype. Currently, we attempt to resolve the signalling pathway that is responsible for these phenotypical changes. Furthermore, we observed that the integrin LFA-1, while being active on monocytes is completely inactive on immature DCs. We discovered that this is not due to a downregulation of LFA-1 at the surface of the DC but rather to a different  organization at the cell surface. While on monocytes LFA-1 is organized in small nanosized clusters, on immature DCs LFA-1 is distributed randomly at the cell surface (Cambi et al Mol. Biol. Cell 2006)""" ;

      rdfs:comment """Our lab generated data on alternatives to the ‘classical’ maturation method (i.e. a cocktail of inflammatory cytokines) for moDC (e.g. ‘clinical grade reagents such as Ampligen TM and Hiltonol TM). Moreover the possibility to co-electroporate moDC with constitutively active TLRs and TAA encoding mRNA was persued. The in vitro charging of monocyte derived DC (moDC) with antigens has been optimised.  In contrast to previous studies, the electroporation of TAA encoding mRNA after in vitro maturation of the moDC resulted in a better electroporation efficiency and antigen presentation.  

We evaluated the capacity of mRNA-electroporated DC as a vaccine for immunotherapy. First, the early DC maturation kinetics and the effect of different lipopolysaccharide incubation periods on the phenotypic maturation profile of DC were determined. Next, we showed that either immature or mature DC are equally well electroporated and express and present the transgene at a comparable level after electroporation. We point out that the mRNA electroporation results in a negative effect on the interleukin (IL)-12p70, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion after maturation. Nevertheless, mRNA-electroporated DC induce an effective cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in vivo. Mature electroporated DC are significantly more potent in eliciting an Ag-specific CD8+ CTL response compared to their immature electroporated counterparts. In addition, a significant improvement in CTL response is obtained both in the primary and in the memory effector phases when CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg) are depleted in vivo prior to immunization. These findings are further substantiated in tumor protection experiments and hold convincing evidence for the merit of Treg cell depletion prior to immunization with mRNA-electroporated DC.

These results facilitate the preparation of DC-vaccines for clinical use. 

A single step procedure for the in vitro maturation and antigen loading of human moDC was optimized. DC were electroporated with mRNA encoding tumor antigens and a putative TLR3 ligand.  In vitro stimulation of naïve T cells indicated the superiority of this approach compared to in vitro stimulation with DC matured with inflammatory cytokines followed by electroporation with TAA encoding mRNA.""" ;

We will do this by applying a unique methodology dedicated to the identification of phagosome proteins in dendritic cells, under various experimental conditions, that we developed at the Curie Institute. This methodology incorporates a unique sample preparation procedure based on 96 well plate complex sample trypsinization, a nano-LC-based peptide separation coupled to MSMS analysis sequencing. This procedure led us to the identification of 600 phagosomal proteins from murine DC phagosomes. 

An integrated software solution has been developed to analyse these results and to perform comparative analysis of phagosome proteomes obtained in various conditions. This methodology has been applied successfully to identify: 
a) a set of proteins specifically associated to phagosomes in DCs but not other phagocytes, such as macrophages, 
b) a set of proteins specifically recruited to phagosomes during DCs maturation induced by various Toll-Like Receptors. 

In collaboration with Norman Pavelka and Paola Ricciardi-Castagnoli (P32), a special effort is put to understand the impact of transcriptome remodelling on phagosome proteome remodelling during DC maturation. This task requires the development of dedicated software solutions that are currently on the way and should open new possibilities for transcriptomic data analysis from the DC-THERA network. 

Proteomic maps will be established for phagosomes formed after phagocytosis through different phagocytic receptors (FcRs, DEC-205, mannose receptor).""" ;

      dc:description "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play critical roles in regulating various cellular functions by transcriptional silencing. MiRNAs can function as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors (oncomirs), depending on cancer types. In this study, using miRNA microarray, we observed that down-regulation of the Notch-1 pathway, by delta-tocotrienol, correlated with up-regulation of miR-34a, in non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLC). Moreover, re-expression of miR-34a by transfection in NSCLC cells resulted in inhibition of cell growth and invasiveness, induction of apoptosis and enhanced p53 activity. Furthermore, cellular mechanism studies revealed that induction of miR-34a decreased the expression of Notch-1 and its downstream targets including Hes-1, Cyclin D1, Survivin, and Bcl-2. Our findings suggest that delta-tocotrienol is a non-toxic activator of mir-34a which can inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, and inhibit invasion, thus offering a potential starting point for the design of novel anticancer agents. © 2012 Wiley-Liss, Inc." ;

In general, pre-existing immune-responses were rather mono-functional with dominating “IFN?-only”, “TNF?-only” and “degranulation-only” cells in the CD8+ compartment. Vaccination not only increased some of these monofunctional subpopulations but also induced occurrence of tumorantigen specific polyfunctional subsets. The further course of our melanoma patients will show whether these vaccination induced new T-cell “flavours” as well as different patterns of homing receptors do translate into better clinical efficacy." ;

We have immunized mice with human DC derived-exosomes and generated hybridomas that produce antibodies recognizing at least the human exosomes. Out of 20 hybridomas, only one appears to recognize specifically DC exosomes and not tumor exosomes nor autologous monocytes or DC or PBL. The Ab produced by this N°13 hybridoma is binding to a protein of about 30kDa. The proteomic analysis of human exosomes allowed us to suspect these proteins as a potential candidate target for our hybridoma 13:

- Signalling: 14-3-3 beta (28 kDa), 14-3-3 eta (28 kDa), 14-3-3 gamma (28 kDa), 14-3-3 zeta (28 kDa)
- Adhesion: CD9 (25 kDa), galectin 3 (27 kDa)
- Enzymes: glucose 6 phosphate isomerase (32 kDa)
- H2-M: MB2d (28 kDa), MB2k1 (28 kDa), MB2p (28 kDa), MB2q1 (28 kDa), MB2r (28 kDa), MB2w3 (28 kDa), MB2w5 (28 kDa)
- Lipid rafts: prohibitin (29 kDa), stomatin (31 kDa)
- Membrane fusion: syntaxin 7 (29 kDa)
- Cytoskeleton: syntenin (32 kDa)
- Others: ribosomal protein L6 (32 kDa)

A mass spectrometry after 2D electrophoresis will be performed on exosomal lysates to formally identify the candidate protein recognized by our hybridoma 13. We hope to obtain a neutralizing Ab to investigate the role of exosome in immunity in vivo.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """Agilent and Affymetrix data were obtained from an expression analysis of DC treated +/- poly I:C +/- kinase inhibitors. We have previously shown that activation of Src family kinases is absolutely required for cytokine production in DC stimulated by agonists of several Toll like receptors. Inhibition of these kinases by the specific inhibitors PP1/2 uncoupled cytokine production from the up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules in DC. 

We investigated gene expression profiles in DC stimulated with PolyI:C, pretreated or not with PP2, microarray analysis was performed. 41 genes were found to be strongly inhibited by PP2; some cytokines, chemokines and the transcription factor IRF-8 are among these genes. 38 genes were partially inhibited by PP2, and the IL-6 gene belongs to this second group. Other 67 genes were not inhibited at all by PP2. The presence of NF-kB inhibitor in this last group confirms that PP2 doesn’t affect the NF-kB pathway from which IkB transcription depends. Another interesting finding is that among the genes that are not inhibited by PP2 there is also the gene of IL-23. To investigate the role of src kinases on IL-23 production, we tested DC supernatants for the presence of IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines after 24 hours of stimulation with R848 (TLR7/8 agonist) or with Poly I:C (TLR3 agonist). We found that PP2 was able to impair IL-12 production, but it did not affect IL-23 production. On the contrary, the amount of IL-23 was higher in PP2-treated MoDC than in untreated cells, especially upon R848 stimulation.

The results obtained with Agilent arrays were compared with those from the Affymetrix platform.""" ;

The effectiveness of the dendritic cell (DC) vaccination protocols that are currently in use could be improved by providing the DCs with a more potent maturation signal. We therefore investigated whether the T-cell stimulatory capacity of human monocyte-derived DCs could be increased by co-electroporation with different combinations of CD40L, CD70, and constitutively active toll-like receptor 4 (caTLR4) encoding mRNA. We show that immature DCs electroporated with CD40L and/or caTLR4 mRNA, but not those electroporated with CD70 mRNA, acquire a mature phenotype along with an enhanced secretion of several cytokines/chemokines. Moreover, these DCs are very potent in inducing naive CD4(+) T cells to differentiate into interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-secreting type 1 T helper (Th1) cells. Further, we assessed the capacity of the electroporated DCs to activate naive HLA-A2-restricted MelanA-specific CD8(+) T cells without the addition of any exogenous cytokines. When all three molecules were combined, a >500-fold increase in MelanA-specific CD8(+) T cells was observed when compared with immature DCs, and a >200-fold increase when compared with cytokine cocktail-matured DCs. In correlation, we found a marked increase in cytolytic and IFN-gamma/tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) secreting CD8(+) T cells. Our data indicate that immature DCs genetically modified to express stimulating molecules can induce tumor antigen-specific T cells in vitro and could prove to be a significant improvement over DCs matured with the methods currently in use.""" ;

A critical factor determining the effectiveness of currently used dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccines, is the DC’s activation or maturation status.  We have shown recently that the T cell stimulatory capacity of DCs pulsed with tumorantigen-derived peptides can be considerably increased by activating the DCs through electroporation with CD40L, CD70 and constitutively active TLR4 encoding mRNA (TriMix DCs).  Here, we investigate whether TriMix DCs can be co-electroporated with whole tumorantigen encoding mRNA.
The T cell stimulatory capacity of TriMix DCs pulsed with the immunodominant MelanA-A2 peptide and of TriMix DCs co-electroporated with MelanA mRNA was compared in vitro.  TriMix DCs were also co-electroporated with Mage-A3, Mage-C2, Tyrosinase or gp100 mRNA.  The capacity of these DCs to stimulate tumorantigen-specific T cells in melanoma patients, was investigated both in vitro prior to vaccination and after DC-vaccination.  
Like peptide-pulsed TriMix DCs, TriMix DCs co-electroporated with MelanA mRNA are very potent in inducing MelanA-specific CD8+ T cells.  These T cells have an activated phenotype, show cytolytic capacity and produce inflammatory cytokines in response to specific stimulation.  TriMix DCs co-electroporated with Tyrosinase are able to stimulate Tyrosinase-specific CD8+ T cells in vitro from the blood of non-vaccinated melanoma patients.  Furthermore, TriMix DCs co-electroporated with Mage-A3, Mage-C2 or Tyrosinase are able to induce antigen-specific CD8+ T cells through vaccination.
TriMix DCs co-electroporated with whole tumorantigen mRNA stimulate antigen-specific T cells both in vitro and through vaccination and thus form a promising new approach for anti-tumor immunotherapy.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """Our lab has obtained data on the molecular signatures for alternatively activated DC.

This type of activation characterizes the state of DC in certain pathophysiological conditions, such as during the resolution of inflammation as well as in chronic inflammatory conditions and in tumors. AA-DC were obtained by culturing immature DC in the presence of a maturative agonists (such as, LPS, CD40L or TNF) and calcitriol, IL-10 or prostaglandin E2. AA-DC showed a decrease in the production of IL-12 but retained most of the ability to secrete other cytokines, such as TNF and CXCL8. The hallmark of AA-DC was the production of the angiogenic cytokine VEGF in vitro, and in vivo when the cells were implanted into the chicken embryo CAM assay. VEGF production by DC was selectively observed only when the DC where alternatively activated. Therefore, VEGF production by DC can be considered a signature of this state of activation. AA-DC induced in the presence of LPS and IL-10 also produced high levels of the long pentraxin PTX3. PTX3 is pattern recognition receptor that plays a pivotal role in humoral innate immunity. DC produced conspicuous amounts of PTX3 when stimulated with LPS and this production is further increased in the presence of IL-10. However, PTX3 production was not increased in other alternative conditions of activation, such as in the presence of dexamethasone or calcitriol. PTX3 has properties similar to antibodies. Its production is induced by pathogen recognition, it recognizes microbial moieties, activates complement and facilitates recognition by phagocytes. Thus, this long pentraxin behaves as a bona fide ante-antibody. In this perspective, it is interesting that IL-10 stimulates B cell differentiation and antibody production. Thus IL-10 stimulates the humoral arm of both innate (PTX3) and adaptive (antibodies) immunity.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """The Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS) is the leading technical and scientific public body of the Italian National Health Service. Its activities include research, control, training and consultation in the interest of public health protection.

- Research and Trial
The Institute conducts scientific research in a wide variety of fields, from cutting-edge molecular and genetic research to population-based studies of risk factors for disease and disability. Research priorities are based on those set forth in the National Health Plan. The Institute is also involved in several major clinical trials, which are frequently conducted in cooperation with the Scientific Institutes for Research and Care (IRCCS) network and Hospitals.

- Inspection, Monitoring and Certification
An important activity of the Institute, which is mandated by the Minister of Health or the Regions, is certification of the chemical and biological purity of drugs and vaccines, as well as inspection and quality control of medical and diagnostic devices and equipment, food products and packaging. It monitors trends in disease, mortality and other health factors and provides technical support for health-related environmental surveys and for investigations of epidemics and other public health problems at national, regional and local level. It also supervises the laboratories engaged in the testing of prohibited substances in sport and the national veterinary institutes. Finally, it has an important role in monitoring and coordinating blood transfusion services and plasma production in Italy.

- Documentation, Information and Publications
The Institute serves as a major source of information relating to public health and biomedicine in Italy through online connections to national and international scientific databases and data banks. It also serves as the national reference centre for MEDLARS (MEDical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System), a comprehensive international data bank coordinated by the US National Library of Medicine (NLM). The Institute produces numerous publications, including a quarterly peer-reviewed journal, technical reports, a monthly newsletter describing the Institute’s major research activities, and a national epidemiological bulletin.

- Training and Scientific Meetings
The Institute plans, implements and evaluates training activities in a wide variety of areas, with courses designed to address the needs of the National Health Service. It develops and tests innovative training methods, including web-based distance learning. Training is provided for various categories of professionals; methods range from short courses and hands-on workshops to more structured and formal courses at national and international level. The topics addressed include health service management and evaluation, epidemiology and biostatistics, training methods, laboratory techniques, diseases control and priority public health issues, and health promotion. The Institute also organises congresses, conferences, workshops and seminars for national and international participants on fundamental public health issues linked to its institutional activities and research. These events are often organised in cooperation with international organisations such as the European Union, specialised UN Agencies and non-governmental organisations with which the Institute maintains close relations.

- International Activities
The Institute plans, implements and evaluates international health projects, ranging from cooperative research and development projects to humanitarian assistance. It actively promotes cooperation at three different levels of involvement: scientific partnerships with industrialised countries (USA, European partners, Japan); scientific and development projects in partnership with economies in transition (including China, South Africa, the Central Asian Republics and countries in Latin America, the Balkans and the Middle East); development partnerships in Africa and countries in turmoil, where humanitarian and technical assistance is provided in close collaboration with the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, various UN Agencies and the World Bank, as well as the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Several members of the Institute serve on panels of experts for the Fund as well as on other international committees and commissions. Current projects include research into the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS and poverty-related diseases, capacity-building for central health administrations, technology transfer in health management and technical support for national public health authorities, usually within the context of health care reform. There is growing interest and cooperation in the application of telematics to health issues, in keeping with the priorities recently established by the G8 and the Italian government.

      dc:description "Objective: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), or ecstasy, is a synthetic drug used recreationally, mainly by young people. It has been suggested that MDMA has a Th cell skewing effect, in which Th1 cell activity is suppressed and Th2 cell activity is increased. Experimental allergic airway inflammation in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized rodents is a useful model to study Th2 response; therefore, based on the Th2 skewing effect of MDMA, we studied MDMA in a model of allergic lung inflammation in OVA-sensitized mice. Methods: We evaluated cell trafficking in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, blood and bone marrow; cytokine production; L-selectin expression and lung histology. We also investigated the effects of MDMA on tracheal reactivity in vitro and mast cell degranulation. Results: We found that MDMA given prior to OVA challenge in OVA-sensitized mice decreased leukocyte migration into the lung, as revealed by a lower cell count in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung histologic analysis. We also showed that MDMA decreased expression of both Th2-like cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10) and adhesion molecules (L-selectin). Moreover, we showed that the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis is partially involved in the MDMA-induced reduction in leukocyte migration into the lung. Finally, we showed that MDMA decreased tracheal reactivity to methacholine as well as mast cell degranulation in situ. Conclusions: Thus, we report here that MDMA given prior to OVA challenge in OVA-sensitized allergic mice is able to decrease lung inflammation and airway reactivity and that hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activation is partially involved. Together, the data strongly suggest an involvement of a neuroimmune mechanism in the effects of MDMA on lung inflammatory response and cell recruitment to the lungs of allergic animals." ;

      rdfs:comment """Data has been obtained on the homing capacity of DC transfected with RNA encoding E/L-Selectin.

We have efficiently transfected DC with RNA encoding a functional protein (E/L-Selectin) which allows entry of DC into LN from HEV. Mouse E/L-S transfected DC, when given i.v.,  homed to LN, whereas non transfected DC home only to the spleen. The novel adherence capacity of human E/L-S transfected DC was demonstrated via sticking to sialyl-LewisX coated slides using a parallel plate flow microscope. RNA transfected human DC could be frozen and thawed without loosing their functionality. 

In an ongoing clinical trial (see WP9) using monocyte-derived and cocktail-matured DC electroporated with a combination of RNAs encoding tumor antigens (MelanA, Mage3, Survivin) and E/L-selectin, we already obtained superior immune responses using E/L-S+ DC compared to E/L-S- DC. 

To demonstrate in-vivo that multiple LN regions can be targeted by i.v. application of  E/L-S DC, we established indium111 labelling of DC and studied its effect on DC migration and T-cell interaction in vitro prior going into patients.  In terms of migratory capacity, which was analyzed using a transwell assay adressing CCR7-mediated migration of DC towards MIP3-ß, we could not find any inhibition by labeling of DC with indium111 up to 4 MBq (100 µCi). In contrast, priming and expansion of MelanA specific naïve CD8 T-cells by DC loaded with MelanA analog peptide or MelanA encoding RNA, was markedly affected by indium111 labeling in a dose dependent manner. Whereas MelanA specific T cell expansion was only slightly reduced using DC labelled with 1MBq of indium111, 2MBq  already completely abrogated specific T cell expansion and labelling with 4MBq even resulted in death of MelanA specific T cells. Therefore Indium111 labelled DC should not be loaded with tumor antigens if applied in patients, which may result in loss of specific immune responses at least at higher labelling intensities usually employed. Interestingly, this aspect had never been uncovered or considered in work done so far by other groups injecting Indium labelled DC previously.""" ;

Only when peptide pools as an antigen source are used PBMC exhibited a slightly higher stimulation capacity compared to whole blood. However, slightly higher background was observed when using PBMC to stimulate with antigen. Lowest background was observed when either peptides or protein were used for stimulation enabling assessment also of rare antigen-specific Th-cells below frequencies of 0.05% of peripheral CD4+ Th-cells. (Meier, Stark et al., 2008). We also tested usage of peptide pool preparations versus recombinant antigen for their stimulation capacity. While working with whole blood no differences in the capacity to elicit antigen-specific activation of Th-cells were observed, stimulation in PBMC induced higher activation (Meier, Stark et al., 2008). 
We also evaluated the influence of the cell density on the stimulation outcome when PBMC were used for induction of Th-cell activation. Optimal Th-cell activation was induced when cultures were initiated with about 5x10E6/ml PBMC. Wrong adjustment of cell densities (e.g. to 1x10E6/ml reduced Th-cell activation to about 1/3 (Meier, Stark et al., 2008). """ ;

The building offers 1,400 square meters of laboratory space including tissue culture rooms, level 2 and 3 biosafety laboratories, and an animal house. Core facilities are available for nucleic acid and protein analysis, cytofluorimetry, cell sorting, and high-resolution microscopy with image analysis. 

The IRB receives support from the city of Bellinzona, the Canton of Ticino, the Swiss Confederation, from private sources as well as from funding agencies. The Helmut Horten Foundation is the major sponsor with an initial contribution covering equipment and running costs for the first five years.

Providing extensive technical and logistic support, the institute offers optimal conditions for high-level research. This environment is expected to foster interaction and collaboration among the research groups, which are active in different areas of biology. The IRB strives to contribute to the progress of biomedical research by studying basic mechanisms of immune defense against bacteria, viruses and tumors, and to find new approaches to diagnostics and therapy.

Eight research groups are established under the guidance of Prof. Antonio Lanzavecchia and their number will grow up to twelve in the forthcoming years. An advisory board of eight internationally known specialists will guarantee standards of personnel appointments and research work. The topics of research range from cellular and functional aspects of the immune response to the molecular mechanisms of inflammation and innate immunity. Basic aspects of cell biology such as ligand-receptor interactions, intracellular signaling, protein structure and folding are also studied. Scientists at the IRB collaborate with several research institutes The IRB organizes seminars, scientific meetings and discussion groups. Moreover, the IRB provides support and training for graduate students from Switzerland and foreign countries.""" ;

      dc:description "Background:  Dermatological activity data has been collected for the same region of south-east Scotland (population of 1.24 million), approximately every five years, since 1981. This has allowed assessment of trends in demand from primary and secondary care, and activity within secondary care dermatology services, assisting planning of dermatological services. Objectives:  To quantify dermatology outpatient workload across the same population to allow comparison with previous studies for trends in practice. Methods:  During November 2010, a standardised proforma was completed for all National Health Service and private practice dermatology outpatient consultations. Demographic data, source and reason for referral, diagnoses, investigations, treatments and disposal were recorded, and comparisons made with five previous studies. Results:  5470 consultations were recorded: 2882 new and 2588 review patients (new:review ratio 1:0.9, male:female 1:1.3, mean age 49 years, range 1 month - 101 years). Ninety one per cent of referrals came from primary care and 9% from secondary care. Fifty eight per cent of referrals were for diagnosis and 32% for hospital management. Diagnostic concordance between referrer and dermatologist ranged from 97% for acne to 14% for melanoma. Benign tumours accounted for 30% of referrals, malignant tumours 13%, dermatitis 13.3%, psoriasis 6.2%, and acne/rosacea 5%. The referral rate rose to 23.2 / 1000 population per annum, with the increase coming mainly from primary care. Conclusions:  Demand for dermatology continues to increase: new referrals have risen by 134% in 30 years, with a 36% increase in the last 5 years, despite corresponding population increases of 5.3% and 3% respectively." ;

We found that CCR6–deficient (CCR6-KO) mice were resistant to induction of EAE but became susceptible when transferred with small number of CCR6-sufficient T cells. CCR6 was found to be required on a first wave of TH-17 cells that entered the CNS through the choroid plexus epithelial cells, which constitutively expressed CCL20 in both mice and humans. CCR6+ T cells triggered entry of a second wave of T cells that migrated in large numbers into the CNS by crossing activated parenchymal vessels. These results reveal distinct molecular requirements and anatomical sites of lymphocytes entry during development of EAE and suggest that the CCR6-CCL20 axis controls an evolutionary conserved pathway of immune surveillance in the brain." ;

Authorized for further training (DGfl-immunologist)

An institute dealing with one syndrome?
The DRFZ has the task to practise basic research in the field of rheumatic diseases. At the moment, 136 men and women work for the institute.
The DRFZ is the only institute in Germany with the exclusive assignment of interdisciplinary research on rheumatic diseases. When recommending an integration of the DRFZ into the Leibniz-Gemeinschaft in 2004, the scientific board emphasised the fact that it is one of the internationally leading institutes in the fields of immunology, experimental rheumatology and epidemiology. 
The concept of cellular pathology, formulated in 1855 by Rudolph Virchow, according to which diseases are caused by a malfunction of cells, is the overall concept of the DRFZ.
The understanding of this malfunction of cells involved in rheumatic diseases is the basic factor in the development of cell therapies at the DRFZ. With the help of those, cells can be treated directly by either correcting their malfunction, removing them from the body or destroying them when still in the body. 
In order to rebuild tissue affected by rheumatic diseases, cells with healing abilities have to be found and activated. The cellular and molecular understanding prepares the ground for effective therapies for rheumatic diseases. 
Our epidemiologists investigate factors influencing the course of inflammatory rheumatic diseases, evaluate the quality degree of medical care today and discuss the necessity of further improvements. This is put into practice in close cooperation with a network of more than 300 rheumatologists from all parts of Germany. In 1993 they started to build up a data bank for the treatment of patients which has become the largest in the world. Separately for adults and children it provides information about the actual state of medical care and possible deficits. More than 200.000 patients informed about their health situation, quality of life and the extend of their pain, some of them over a period of several years. The doctors collected and documented the corresponding medical data.   

Cooperation with other research groups
One important pillar of the DRFZ’s work is the close cooperation with other research groups. The scientists from the DRFZ work together in 11 working groups and 10 so called liaison groups, where they cooperate with colleagues from other institutes and from the Charité Berlin. In 1999 the German Research Council (DFG) installed the first special research sector at the Charité in which the DRFZ was involved. In the following years this was complemented by five more sectors integrated in the research groups of the DRFZ.
Furthermore, the DRFZ is involved in seven research networks of the EU. 
The DRFZ is one of the centres within the competence network “Inflammatory Rheumatic Diseases”, founded by the Federal Ministry of Science in 1998.
Abdreas Radbruch succeeded Henning Zeidler from Hannover and Gerd-Rüdiger Burmester from the Charité as the network’s spokesman and led it into its third funding phase in 2004/2005. In autumn 2005 Angela Zink, vice director of the DRFZ, became spokesperson of the competence network for 2006 and 2007. 
The project “Berlinflame”, a cooperation with partners from the Charité in 2001, made the DRFZ one of five national centres in the research sector “Infection and Inflammation” of the National Genome Research Network (NGFN). In the meantime the project has been renamed SIPAGE and prolonged until 2007.
In the funding programme “Tissue Engineering” of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research several groups of the DRFZ cooperate with partners from the Charité and companies for biotechnology.

Further information about all those projects can be found under “Research”.

Teachings
Through three confounded chairs supported by the DRFZ:
- “Experimental Rheumatology”, Prof. Dr. Andreas Radbruch
- “Clinical Rheumatology”, Prof. Dr. Falk Hiepe, and
-  “Epidemiology”, Prof. Dr. Angela Zink,  
the institute is closely linked to the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin.

Scientific Publications
The effective cooperation of scientists within the DRFZ as well as with partners from the Charité and other research institutes, not only in Berlin, is also reflected in the scientific publications. Most of the ca. 100 publications per year are co-authored by scientists from the DRFZ and those from other institutes. It is especially encouraging that the share of publications in highly estimated international journals like the Journal of Experimental Medicine, Arthritis and Rheumatism, Blood or the Journal of Immunology has constantly increased over the last few years.

Sponsorship
The institute is financed by the Federal State of Berlin. Certain research projects are supported by the Federal Ministry of Research, the German Research Council and the European Union. Further funding is welcome at any time.""" ;

Although some courses at the ULB's Faculty of Law were already being taught in Dutch in 1935, it was not until 1963 that almost all the faculties offered courses in Dutch. The Dutch-speaking university was finally split off from its French-speaking counterpart on 1 October 1969.

The University of Zurich was founded in 1833, though its origins stretch back as far as 1525 and the days of protestant reformer Ulrich Zwingli. Today the University enjoys international renown as a place of education and research. Two thousand lecturers in 140 special institutes provide the broadest range of subjects and courses available from any Swiss seat of higher education. With 24,000 students and 1,900 graduates every year, Zurich is also Switzerland’s largest university. The University provides academic services, works with the private sector and considers itself part of a national and global network for the acquisition and dissemination of knowledge.

Zurich’s international reputation is based on groundbreaking research, particularly in molecular biology, brain research and anthropology, and on the work of the University Hospital and Veterinary Hospital.

The University’s researchers, lecturers and students benefit from the infrastructure that Zurich provides as a center of teaching and research. Apart from its own institutions, the University offers its members access to archive collections, libraries and the facilities of the Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), as well as to the city’s private institutions. Nine museums and collections, covering subjects from anthropology to zoology, constitute yet another valuable academic resource.""" ;

      dc:description "PURPOSEWe sought to evaluate the risk effect of tanning bed use on skin cancers among teenage and young adults. We also expected to determine whether a dose-response relationship was evident. PATIENTS AND METHODSWe observed 73,494 female nurses for 20 years (from 1989 to 2009) in a large and well-characterized cohort in the United States and investigated whether frequency of tanning bed use during high school/college and at ages 25 to 35 years were associated with a risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and melanoma. We used Cox proportional hazards models and carefully adjusted for host risk factors, ultraviolet index of residence, and sun exposure behaviors at a young age.ResultsDuring follow-up, 5,506 nurses were diagnosed with BCC, 403 with SCC, and 349 with melanoma. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of skin cancer for an incremental increase in use of tanning beds of four times per year during both periods was 1.15 (95% CI, 1.11 to 1.19; P < .001) for BCC, 1.15 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.31; P = .03) for SCC, and 1.11 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.27; P = .13) for melanoma. Compared with tanning bed use at ages 25 to 35 years, we found a significantly higher risk of BCC for use during high school/college (multivariable-adjusted HR for use more than six times per year compared with no use was 1.73 during high school/college v 1.28 at ages 25 to 35 years; P for heterogeneity < .001). CONCLUSIONOur data provide evidence for a dose-response relationship between tanning bed use and the risk of skin cancers, especially BCC, and the association is stronger for patients with a younger age at exposure." ;

The IFN?-ELISPOT analysis and proliferation with its accompanying cytokine production revealed a strong and broad vaccine-induced T cell response. The strength of the immune response (defined as breath and magnitude of the response) was significantly higher in the patients with a complete remission (CR) than in the patients with no changes (NC) in the lesion size. Phenotypical anlaysis revealed a strong induction of CD4+ T-cells specifically against HPV16 E6 and E7, whereas CD8+ T cells were found merely against HPV16 E6 and to a less broad array of epitopes within each patient. This analysis was done after one in vitro restimulation, however, by directly ex vivo flow cytometric analysis hardly any CD8+ T cell response could be detected. The T cell cultures obtained from the biopsies taken of the last vaccination site were found to be HPV16 peptides specific in 3/5 tested NR patients and in 4/5 tested CR. However, recognition of the recombinant HPV16 E6 and/or E7 protein was observed in 1/5 cultures from NR patients and 4/5 cultures of the CR patients, suggesting the differences in vaccine-induced T-cell reactivity. Tissue biopsies of the VIN lesion before and after vaccination showed only in one patient a HPV16-specific T-cell response, which was against HPV16 E6 and merely of the type 2 cytokine producing T cells. Notably, no T-cell cultures could be obtained from VIN biopsies taken from the CR patients. In conclusion, the HPV16 E6 and E7 synthetic long peptides vaccine is highly immunogenic, in that it increases the number and activity of HPV16-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells to a broad array of epitopes in all patients. The expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-specific T-cells, both considered to be important in the anti-tumor response indicates the immunotherapeutic potential of this vaccine. Addition of a strong toll-like receptor ligand might increase the CD8 response in frequency and to a broader set of epitopes.""" ;

Patient care: routine care, high-level clinical care, and in particular, high-level reference care.
Research: both fundamental and bedside, healthcare-oriented research. 
Education for the faculties of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. 
Specialist medical training. 
Additional training, both post-doctoral and post-vocational. 

The LUMC comprises the Leiden University Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine of Leiden University. The LUMC, which employs approximately 7000 people, is located close to Leiden central station. 

The mission of the Leiden University Medical Center is to perform its core tasks at the highest possible level. Consequently, the LUMC aims to provide the best possible quality regarding both medical technology and patient care and treatment. The keywords are openness and information. 

With regard to research, the LUMC intends to maintain its position among the international elite with its centres of excellence and research focuses. The interaction of fundamental research and patient care forms the basis of our management policy. 

This means that the range of top clinical functions and reference tasks performed by the LUMC, many of them national or international, are built on a strong scientific foundation. In addition to its supraregional and national functions, the LUMC offers quality and quantity across the entire range of medical science. This is a must if the LUMC is to fulfil its public function as an innovator of healthcare and the healthcare system as well as its scientific role as a tester of new and existing medical technology. 

It goes without saying that the same applies to student teaching and specialist training. Clearly, there are some tasks the LUMC cannot, or does not wish to, perform on its own, so close collaboration with qualified general hospitals is required. Consequently, the LUMC continues to create and maintain networking structures in the fields mentioned earlier. In doing so, the 'appropriate use' of healthcare facilities remains a sine qua non. 

Through its teaching facilities, the LUMC will be turning out patient-centred doctors and scientists with a critical scientific attitude and the right dose of scientific curiosity. The gratification offered by academic pursuits is an essential ingredient. Further internationalisation of education is high on the list of priorities. 

Based on the principle of 'life-long learning', the LUMC's Boerhaave Committee plays a pivotal role of increasing importance as the largest post-academic medical training organisation in the Netherlands. 

The LUMC intends to even further consolidate this position, and to elevate the Leiden post-vocational training courses to the same level. Commitment to the team effort by each and every person working at the Leiden University Medical Center is a prerequisite for the realisation of these ambitions.""" ;

The aim of this study was to analyze the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical characteristics of 12 cases of primary nasal melanomas in Brazil. Twelve cases of primary nasal melanoma were analyzed histologically and by immunohistochemistry using the antibodies S-100 protein, HMB-45, Melan-A, CD63 (NKI/C3), CD68/KP1, fatty acid synthase (FASN), and Ki-67. The mean age of the patients was 60 years, and 7 of 12 patients were men. Microscopically, 10 cases presented level III of invasion; 4 were amelanotic; and in 7, cells were epithelioid. S-100 protein and FASN were positive in all cases, whereas 9, 8, 7, and 6 cases were positive for HMB-45, Melan-A, CD63 (NKI/C3), and CD68/KP1, respectively. Ki-67 labeling index ranged from 11.45% to 28.5% of positive cells. S-100 protein is more frequently expressed in nasal melanomas than in HMB-45, Melan-A, CD63 (NKI/C3), and CD68/KP1. FASN seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of nasal melanomas, and also, it can be helpful to confirm the diagnosis." ;

      dc:description "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Exposure to wood smoke is associated with respiratory symptoms, whereas knowledge on systemic effects is limited. We investigated effects on systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and microvascular function (MVF) after controlled wood smoke exposure. METHODS: In a randomised, double-blinded, cross-over study 20 non-smoking atopic subjects were exposed at rest to 14, 220, or 354 mug/m3 of particles from a well-burning modern wood stove for 3 h in a climate controlled chamber with 2 week intervals. We investigated the level of oxidatively damaged DNA, inflammatory markers and adhesion molecules before and 0, 6 and 20 h after exposure. Six h after exposure we measured MVF non-invasively by digital peripheral artery tonometry following arm ischemia. RESULTS: The MVF score was unaltered after inhalation of clean air (1.58 +/- 0.07; mean +/- SEM), low (1.51 +/- 0.07) or high (1.61 +/- 0.09) concentrations of wood smoke particles in atopic subjects, whereas unexposed non-atopic subjects had higher score (1.91 +/- 0.09). The level of oxidatively damaged DNA, mRNA of ITGAL, CCL2, TNF, IL6, IL8, HMOX1, and OGG1 and surface marker molecules ICAM1, ITGAL and L-selectin in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were not affected by inhalation of wood smoke particles. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to wood smoke had no effect on markers of oxidative stress, DNA damage, cell adhesion, cytokines or MVF in atopic subjects." ;

The San Raffaele hospital is a private Scientific Institute, belonging to the San Raffaele del Monte Tabor Foundation, recognised by the Italian Ministry of Health as a Scientific Institute carrying out biomedical research and clinical activities of relevant national interest (IRCCS). According to the inspiring principles of its founding Organisation, the mission of the San Raffaele is to cure and assist diseased individuals, following the Gospel proposition: \"Go, teach, heal\". Such a mission is accomplished by focusing every aspect of the Institute’s activities on Man, viewed as an multifaceted entity endowed with inseparable biological, psychological and spiritual elements.

San Raffaele Institute is relentlessly pursuing its three interrelated lines of clinics, research and education since 1971 when it was established and represented one of the first examples of a fully independent private hospital in Italy. Shortly after its foundation San Raffaele was granted the status of IRCCS (Research Hospital), which favoured its development as a site for clinical research, originally specialized in diabetes and metabolic disorders. 

In 1992 San Raffaele expanded further with the inauguration of DIBIT, a building dedicated to basic science, with a research space of about 12,000 square meters where at present 250 people are employed in basic, translational and clinical research, including scientists, technicians and administrative personnel, along with additional 300 fellows, consultants, trainees and graduate students. DIBIT is part of the largest biomedical science park in Italy, which includes San Raffaele Hospital with more than 1300 beds, Science Park Raf, created to support the Foundation’s development objectives, and the University Vita-Salute San Raffaele.  

The University Vita-Salute San Raffaele was established in 1996 and now hosts the Faculties of Medicine, of Psychology and of Philosophy. Further, the teaching activities include, besides a whole range of Schools of Specialization in different medical branches, international Ph.D. programs in Cellular and Molecular Biology and in Molecular Medicine. 

Within 2007, the DIBIT-2 project will expand almost three-fold the floor space devoted to research and will substantially increase and empower research in the different fields where San Raffaele has become highly renowned. Considering the interactions that DIBIT entails with San Raffaele Hospital, Science Park Raf and the University it is highly plausible to believe that in turn this expansion will allow to improve logistic and organization, to rationalize clinical activity, to catalyse industrial attention and to attract the best students.

Much effort and many resources have been invested in basic, preclinical and clinical research. Our scientific production continues to show quite an impressive progress in terms of both number of publications and overall quality. In 2006, 678 scientific papers were published, with a total impact factor of 3400. These figures confirm the Institute’s leading position in Italy, strongly support the ability to attract support from public (Ministry of Health, Superior Institute of Health, Ministry of University and Research, European Community, NIH and, for a small amount, CNR) and from private sources as well including charity foundations (mainly Telethon, the Italian Association for Cancer Research and Bank Foundations) and are the basis for the solid international reputation acquired over the years. Telethon is funding two research centers at San Raffaele: the San Raffaele-Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy of Genetic Disease (HSR-TIGET) which is pioneering the clinical application of gene transfer technology and the Stem Cell Research Institute (SCRI), which studies the biology and the potential clinical applications of stem cells, a field in which San Raffaele Institute is a world leader.

In the last few years the explosive development and diversification of biomedical technologies, by allowing impressive achievements such as the complete sequencing of the human genome, have revolutionized our approach to medical problems and radically modified the scientific scenario thereby opening the doors to a new type of medicine: “molecular medicine”. In the near future researchers’ efforts will be dedicated to the elucidation of the mechanisms of regulation and expression of different genes and the definition of the functions of their products, to the development of new diagnostic tools able to allow early and presymptomatic diagnosis and to the design of more appropriate, biologically-based and possibly individually-tailored therapeutic approaches. 

San Raffaele Scientific Institute has championed from the very beginning this new type of medicine, whereby basic researchers, clinical investigators and physicians operate together to translate basic research into medical practice, which means to develop molecular endpoints in clinical material and use them to develop pilot studies or clinical trials with the goal of providing both acceleration of cure and optimisation of care. In 2001, San Raffaele Institute was acknowledged, by the Health Minister, as the IRCCS for Molecular Medicine. 

Thanks to the effort and enthusiasm of scientists, physicians, students and of all the people working at San Raffaele, our new molecular medicine center will provide, in the immediate future, either new or less intrusive diagnostic and therapeutical approaches, ready to use within the public Italian health system.""" ;

Here, we suggest a novel type of tumor vaccines, with well-studied CTL epitopes presented on highly immunogenic virus-like particle (VLP) carriers. Cancer-germline gene MAGE-3 encodes for an antigenic nonapeptide (MAGE-3(168-176) peptide) that is recognized by CTLs on human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A1 and HLA-B35 molecules. A set of recombinant genes encoding hepatitis B virus core protein carrying MAGE-3 epitope was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli cells. Variants that led to formation of chimeric VLPs in vivo were purified and analyzed for their DNA binding properties in vitro. VLPs exhibiting the most pronounced nucleic acid binding affinity were selected and loaded either with single-stranded DNA oligodeoxynucleotides rich in nonmethylated CG motifs, or with longer double-stranded DNA fragments. Packaged DNA was protected, at least partially, against the action of bacterial DNase. Such highly purified chimeric VLPs with entrapped immunomodulatory sequences could possibly be used as antitumor vaccines." ;

The IFN?-ELISPOT analysis and proliferation with its accompanying cytokine production revealed a strong and broad vaccine-induced T cell response. The strength of the immune response (defined as breath and magnitude of the response) was significantly higher in the patients with a complete remission (CR) than in the patients with no changes (NC) in the lesion size. Phenotypical anlaysis revealed a strong induction of CD4+ T-cells specifically against HPV16 E6 and E7, whereas CD8+ T cells were found merely against HPV16 E6 and to a less broad array of epitopes within each patient. This analysis was done after one in vitro restimulation, however, by directly ex vivo flow cytometric analysis hardly any CD8+ T cell response could be detected. The T cell cultures obtained from the biopsies taken of the last vaccination site were found to be HPV16 peptides specific in 3/5 tested NR patients and in 4/5 tested CR. However, recognition of the recombinant HPV16 E6 and/or E7 protein was observed in 1/5 cultures from NR patients and 4/5 cultures of the CR patients, suggesting the differences in vaccine-induced T-cell reactivity. Tissue biopsies of the VIN lesion before and after vaccination showed only in one patient a HPV16-specific T-cell response, which was against HPV16 E6 and merely of the type 2 cytokine producing T cells. Notably, no T-cell cultures could be obtained from VIN biopsies taken from the CR patients. In conclusion, the HPV16 E6 and E7 synthetic long peptides vaccine is highly immunogenic, in that it increases the number and activity of HPV16-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells to a broad array of epitopes in all patients. The expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-specific T-cells, both considered to be important in the anti-tumor response indicates the immunotherapeutic potential of this vaccine. Addition of a strong toll-like receptor ligand might increase the CD8 response in frequency and to a broader set of epitopes.""" ;

This center of excellence is part of the Luminy science campus, that comprises fundamental research laboratories and biotech start-ups located between Marseilles and Cassis on the mediterranean coast.
Since 2004, the CIML has been relocated in one new and fully equipped 6.000 m2 building, the construction of which was possible thanks to the CNRS, Inserm, ARC, the city of Marseilles, the Bouches-du-Rhône County and the Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur Region.

230 people work at CIML. They are distributed among 20 research teams, administration, technical services and scientific common services including imaging, proteomics, transgenesis facilities and three scientific platforms: microscopy (PICsL platform), bio-optics (MOSAIC platform) and functional exploration of the mouse model (RIO-Marseille-Nice Genopole platform).

The main Immunology-based areas of research investigated by CIML teams are: ontogeny, lymphocyte and myeloid cell activation and differentiation, phagocytosis, host-pathogen interactions and cell death. 
Ciml 2000	 


The organization of the CIML is very unique in France. It is a federation of research teams, the size and the duration of which are limited. The Director is elected for a four-year term that can be renewed only once. Mutualisation of most of resources allows synergies and high-scale savings. Another specificity is that CIML has been successful in hiring researchers from foreign countries (eight group leaders are from abroad). In addition, long-term collaborative efforts have been established between CIML, universities, hospitals and private companies (four biotechs emerged from the work of CIML scientists: Immunotech, Innate Pharma, Ipsogen, Oz Bioscience).

The future of the Centre d’Immunologie is guaranteed by the presence of several modules of laboratories that have been kept empty for future new teams with scientific programs able to complement already on site studies and/or to bring forward more relationship with companies. CIML scientific activity is submitted to a strong evaluation system controlled by an external international Scientific Advisory Board working in close contact with the National Evaluation Committees from Inserm and CNRS.""" ;

      dc:description "The concept of Xp11.2 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) was recently established as a tumor affecting 15% of RCC patients <45 years. Many patients present with advanced stage with frequent lymph node metastases. Histologically, Xp11.2 RCC is characterized by mixed papillary nested/alveolar growth pattern and tumor cells with clear and/or eosinophilic, voluminous cytoplasm. Neoplastic cells show intense nuclear immunoreactivity to TFE3, while focal immunostaining for melanocytic markers, including melanosome-associated antigen or Melan A in some cases, are also noted. Alpha smooth muscle actin and TFEB are consistently negative. Ultrastructurally, the ASPL-TFE3 RCC variant contains rhomboid crystals in the cytoplasm, similar to that observed in alveolar soft part sarcoma. The fusion of the TFE3 gene with several different genes, including ASPL(17q25), PRCC(1q21), PSF(1q34), NonO (Xq12) and CLTC (17q23) have been identified to date. The behavior of Xp11.2 RCC in children and young adults is considered as indolent even when diagnosed at advanced stage, including lymph node metastasis. However, Xp11.2 RCC in older patients behaves in a more aggressive fashion. Therapy includes nephrectomy with extended lymphadenectomy. There may be a role for new protease inhibitors in advanced inoperable disease. Further research is required to correlate clinical behavior with the expanding genetic spectrum of this tumor, and to establish standard therapy protocols for primary and metastatic lesions." ;

      dc:description "Tumor regressions have been observed in a small proportion of melanoma patients vaccinated with a MAGE-A3 peptide presented by HLA-A1, administered as peptide, ALVAC canarypox virus containing a MAGE-A3 minigene, or peptide-pulsed dendritic cells (DC). There was a correlation between tumor regression and the detection of anti-MAGE-3.A1 CTL responses. These responses were monoclonal and often of a very low magnitude after vaccination with peptide or ALVAC, and usually polyclonal and of a higher magnitude after DC vaccination. These results suggested that, at least in some patients, surprisingly few anti-MAGE-3.A1 T-cells could initiate a tumor regression process. To understand the role of these T cells, we carried out a functional analysis of anti-MAGE-3.A1 CTL clones derived from vaccinated patients who displayed tumor regression. The functional avidities of these CTL clones, evaluated in lysis assays, were surprisingly low, suggesting that high avidity was not part of the putative capability of these CTL to trigger tumor rejection. Most anti-MAGE-3.A1 CTL clones obtained after DC vaccination, but not after peptide or ALVAC vaccination, produced interleukin 10. Transcript profiling confirmed these results and indicated that approximately 20 genes, including CD40L, prostaglandin D2 synthase, granzyme K, and granzyme H, were highly differentially expressed between the anti-MAGE-3.A1 CTL clones derived from patients vaccinated with either peptide-ALVAC or peptide-pulsed DC. These results indicate that the modality of vaccination with a tumor-specific antigen influences the differentiation pathway of the antivaccine CD8 T-cells, which may have an effect on their capacity to trigger a tumor rejection response." ;

When HPV-18 E6 was tested, we found a very high percentage of responders among women with high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions, whose level of IFN gamma produced predicts the clinical outcome after surgery.

      rdfs:comment """Tissue biopsies of the last vaccination site and of the VIN lesion prior to the first vaccination and 3 months after the last vaccination were analysed for the presence of HPV16-specific T cells.

The IFN?-ELISPOT analysis and proliferation with its accompanying cytokine production revealed a strong and broad vaccine-induced T cell response. The strength of the immune response (defined as breath and magnitude of the response) was significantly higher in the patients with a complete remission (CR) than in the patients with no changes (NC) in the lesion size. Phenotypical anlaysis revealed a strong induction of CD4+ T-cells specifically against HPV16 E6 and E7, whereas CD8+ T cells were found merely against HPV16 E6 and to a less broad array of epitopes within each patient. This analysis was done after one in vitro restimulation, however, by directly ex vivo flow cytometric analysis hardly any CD8+ T cell response could be detected. The T cell cultures obtained from the biopsies taken of the last vaccination site were found to be HPV16 peptides specific in 3/5 tested NR patients and in 4/5 tested CR. However, recognition of the recombinant HPV16 E6 and/or E7 protein was observed in 1/5 cultures from NR patients and 4/5 cultures of the CR patients, suggesting the differences in vaccine-induced T-cell reactivity. Tissue biopsies of the VIN lesion before and after vaccination showed only in one patient a HPV16-specific T-cell response, which was against HPV16 E6 and merely of the type 2 cytokine producing T cells. Notably, no T-cell cultures could be obtained from VIN biopsies taken from the CR patients. In conclusion, the HPV16 E6 and E7 synthetic long peptides vaccine is highly immunogenic, in that it increases the number and activity of HPV16-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells to a broad array of epitopes in all patients. The expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-specific T-cells, both considered to be important in the anti-tumor response indicates the immunotherapeutic potential of this vaccine. Addition of a strong toll-like receptor ligand might increase the CD8 response in frequency and to a broader set of epitopes.""" ;

For intracellular assessment of CD154 induced in the course of short-term activation target cells are stimulated with antigen for 6h in the presence of the secretion inhibitor BrefA (for 4h). For extracellular analysis of live antigen-specific Th-cells cells are stimulated in the presence of an anti-CD40 blocking antibody and biotinylated anti-CD154 antibody. We have used this system to detect antigen-specific Th-cells after in vitro or ex vivo stimulation.  Since the entire population of antigen-specific Th-cells can be assessed in combination with intracellular cytokine analysis the methodology enables a combined quantitative and qualitative highly sensitive monitoring of Th-cell immunity (also after DC vaccination).

We have directly visualized antigen-presenting cells using a mAb reacting to an antigenic peptide derived from the parasite LACK antigen bound to I-Ad MHC class II molecule. I-Ad/LACK complexes were readily detected at the surface of freshly purified parasite-containing DC which expressed a CD8?- CD11b+ F4/80+ gp40- surface phenotype. As demonstrated by electron microscopy some DC contained live amastigotes and expressed I-Ad/LACK complexes in the membrane of the parasitophorous vacuole.

Results obtained from the LC-MS/MS analysis of the integral plasma membrane proteome of D1 cells stimulated for 24 hours with LPS have been compared to the results obtained from immature D1 cells. As expected, DC up-regulated the cell surface expression of all proteins known to be part of the so-called “immunological synapse”, namely MHC class II (region E and K), CD40, CD80, CD86 and ICAM. Interestingly, LPS stimulation caused down-regulation of the AXL receptor, which has been reported to be associated in vivo with the control of the responsiveness of antigen-presenting cells to LPS. Although these data still need independent validation, we would like to propose that DC need to down-regulate this inhibitory receptor upon encountering a maturation stimulus in order to be released from their immature state and to be licensed to achieve a fully mature phenotype." ;

The partner has been trying to quantify the relative amount of 400 proteins. 

They have also indexed better this list and are currently comparing it to a list of proteins present in macrophages lysosomes (in collaboration with M. Desjardins, Uni of Montreal). They hope to distinguish specific features of DCs to further understand the antigen processing and presentation abilities of these cells in response to pathogens. 

Meanwhile, they have finalized their effort and have been repeating 3 times this analysis to put quantitative figures on the qualitative list of identified proteins. This list has been transferred to Duccio Cavalieri as part of the DC-ATLAS effort. They have identified several proteins of interest and are waiting to have a sufficient staffing to characterize their function in DC response to pathogens.

The initiation of cytotoxic immune responses requires the direct interaction between naïve CD8+ T lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Multi-photon imaging showed that during priming, naïve T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) establish sequentially brief (i.e. minutes) and long (hours) antigen-specific contacts. We observed that ICAM-1 expression by mature DCs is critical for long-lasting contacts with CD8+ T cells, but dispensable for short-lived antigen-specific interactions. Serial brief T cell-dendritic cell contacts induced early CD8+ T cell activation, proliferation and effector CTL differentiation in the first few days after immunization. ICAM-1-deficient mature DCs, however, failed to induce fully effective priming, as CD8+ T in the LNs draining the immunization site produced reduced levels of IFN?, were clonally depleted after 2 weeks, and the mice failed to respond to re-challenge. Our results indicate that ICAM-1-dependent long lasting interactions between mature DCs and naïve CD8+ T cells determine the survival of activated CD8+ T cells and the establishment of effective memory." ;

Although the immune system evolved to fight infections, it may also attack and destroy solid tumors. In most cases, tumor rejection is initiated by CD8+ CTLs, which infiltrate solid tumors, recognize tumor antigens and kill tumor cells. We used a combination of two-photon intravital microscopy and immunofluorescence on ordered sequential sections to analyze the infiltration and destruction of solid tumors by CTLs. We show that in the periphery of a thymoma growing subcutaneously, activated CTLs migrate with high instant velocities. When the tumors express cognate antigens the CTLs are arrested in close contact to tumor cells. In regions of the tumors where the tumor cells are dead, CTL motility resumes, using apparently non-guided trajectories, or following collagen fibers or blood vessels. Strikingly, CTLs followed blood vessels for extended lengths, adopting an elongated morphology. CTLs also infiltrated tumors in depth, but only when the tumor cells express the cognate CTL antigen. In tumors that do not express the CTL cognate antigen, we observe peripheral infiltration by CTLs, but the lymphocytes neither stop moving, nor kill tumor cells or infiltrate tumors deeply. Antigen expression by tumor cells therefore determines both CTL motility within the tumor and the depth of tumor infiltration. This work is currently submitted for publication.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """Our group has produced in-vivo multi-photon microscopy imaging data on the distribution and motility of NK cells by tracking migration of DC-primed NK cells in vivo. Since LPS-activated DC are potent inducers of NK cell priming and lymph nodes appear to be a key place in which DC and NK cell interactions occur, we have investigated the in vivo capacity of resting and DC-primed NK cells to reach the draining lymph nodes. DC –activated NK cells reach the draining lymph node within 24 hours after intravenous injection and persist there for at least 72 hours. NK cells distribute at the periphery of T cell areas, where also DC are known to be located. By further analysis of the molecular mechanisms responsible for NK cell activation by LPS-primed DC, we have found that three soluble DC-derived molecules, IL-2, type I interferons (IFNs), and IL-18, are necessary and sufficient to elicit efficient production of IFN gamma from NK cells. These analyses have been performed also in vivo by using appropriate mouse models in which conditional ablation of DCs can be achieved and we have confirmed the relevance in vivo of DC-derived IL-18, type I IFNs and IL-2 in NK cell activation.

We plan to study the physiological relevance of NFAT activation in DCs and of CD14-mediated activation of NFAT pathway in vivo. We also plan to describe the TLR4 and CD14 signal transduction pathway in DCs following LPS activation.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """The initiation of a multi partner trial is planned and data will be generated. The DC-THERA trial will compare the use of ‘TRI-MIX’ RNA in clinical trials that were already underway at each of the three centres (Nijmegen Medical School, Nijmegen; Friedrich-Alexander University, Erlangen; Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels).

It was decided that Friedrich-Alexander University, Erlangen, would apply for a licence to prepare GMP-grade ‘TRI-MIX’ RNA and subsequently supply this for all three centres.

The multi-centre trial is a well-standardised, two-arm, multi-centre clinical trial in melanoma patients comparing DC transfected with mRNA coding for constitutively active TLR-4, CD40 and CD70 (‘TRI-MIX’) with other modalities. The trial will be conducted across the 3 centres mentioned above using standardised SOPs – both for preparation of DC and for subsequent immunomonitoring. At these respective centres the following will be compared:

1) peptide-pulsed DC, matured either with the standard maturation cocktail (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha, PGE2) or transfected with ‘TRI-MIX’, and administered intra-nodally under ultrasound guidance (Nijmegen)
2) antigen mRNA-transfected DC, matured either with the standard maturation cocktail (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha, PGE2) or transfected with ‘TRI-MIX’, and administered subcutaneously (Erlangen)
3) antigen mRNA-transfected DC, co-transfected with ‘TRI-MIX’, comparing intradermal vaccination with intradermal plus intravenous vaccination (Brussels).

The analyses of all DC vaccination trials published has shown that this general vaccination strategy is clearly promising given the fact that the adoptive transfer of antigen-loaded DC (i.e. DC vaccination) appears more immunogenic than other vaccination strategies and clinical effects have also been observed even with first generation DC vaccines. The major deficit in this field is that the obvious variables are simply not addressed in a well-coordinated fashion to allow rapid optimization. This is a pity as DC vaccination is rather unique in that it allows to control ex vivo many biological aspects of DC relevant for optimized DC vaccination but also for other more conventional vaccine strategies (which also depend on DC as antigen in various formats + adjuvant is injected which has to reach and activate DC in situ). The reason for the lack of coordinated testing including combination strategies appears to differ in industry and academia. Biotech companies naturally focus on strategies which are covered by their intellectual property and patents, and in academia there are people with different ideas and visions who in addition have to “publish and perish” even if dealing with mid- to long-term efforts such as clinical trials for which in addition there is insufficient funding. 

After treatment of 50% of the patients (i.e. 15 patients in the Tri-Mix-DC arm) or by the end of 2009, whichever comes first, we will perform an interim analysis of this immunogenicity trial. A final immunogenicity analysis, which might identify a particularly immunogenic superior DC vaccine, will be available by mid 2010. The clinical fate of the patients will be followed further but this is not the endpoint of this immunogenicity trial. """ ;

DCs were exposed to cytochalasin D (10 microg/ml, TebuBio) for 30 minutes at 4°C. After washing with cold PBS, DCs were stimulated with S. cerevisiae yeast cells or spores at a DC:stimuli ratio of 4:1 for 24 hours. IL-12p70 production was assessed by ELISA.

IL-12p70 blocking assay
In order to assess the importance of IL-12p70 in balancing Th1/Th17 response two different experiments were performed.
In one case, DCs were stimulated for 8 hours with live spores of S. cerevisiae and C. albicans hyphae at a stimuli:DC ratio of 4:1 in the presence of different concentration of human recombinant IL12p70 (0, 1, 10 and 100 ng/ml).
In the second experiment, DCs were pre-incubated with different concentrations (0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 microg/ml) of a monoclonal anti-human IL-12 antibody for 2 hours, then stimulated for 8 hours with live S. cerevisiae cells in a stimuli:DC ratio of 4:1. 
The ability of these stimulated DCs to drive CD4+ T cells polarization towards a Th1 response was assessed by measuring of IFNgamma and IL-17 in T cells 5-day culture supernatants.""" ;

We have directly visualized antigen-presenting cells using a mAb reacting to an antigenic peptide derived from the parasite LACK antigen bound to I-Ad MHC class II molecule. I-Ad/LACK complexes were readily detected at the surface of freshly purified parasite-containing DC which expressed a CD8?- CD11b+ F4/80+ gp40- surface phenotype. As demonstrated by electron microscopy some DC contained live amastigotes and expressed I-Ad/LACK complexes in the membrane of the parasitophorous vacuole. Therefore, LACK could be processed and presented to T cells by infected DC in vivo .Furthermore, the presence of I-Ad/LACK complexes on the membrane of parasite-containing phagosomes demonstrated that peptide loading was occuring in this cellular compartment." ;

      dc:description "BACKGROUND: Low vitamin D levels are common, and are associated with a higher incidence of future vascular events. We tested whether vitamin D supplementation could improve endothelial function and other markers of vascular function in patients with a history of myocardial infarction. METHODS: Parallel group, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomised trial. Patients with a history of myocardial infarction were randomised to receive 100,000 units of oral vitamin D3 or placebo at baseline, 2months and 4months. Outcomes were measured at baseline, 2 and 6months. Reactive hyperaemia index on fingertip plethysmography was the primary outcome. Secondary outcome measures included blood pressure, cholesterol, C-reactive protein, von Willebrand factor, tumour necrosis factor alpha, E-selectin, B-type natriuretic peptide, thrombomodulin and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. RESULTS: 75 patients were randomised, mean age 66years. 74/75 (99%) completed 6month follow-up. 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels increased in the intervention group relative to placebo (+13 vs +1nmol/L, p=0.04). There was no between-group difference in change in reactive hyperaemia index between baseline and 6months (-0.18 vs -0.07, p=0.40). Of the secondary outcomes, only C-reactive protein showed a significant decline in the intervention arm relative to placebo at 6months (-1.3 vs 2.0mg/L, p=0.03). Systolic blood pressure (+1.4 vs +2.3mmHg, p=0.79), diastolic blood pressure (+2.0 vs +0.8mmHg, p=0.54) and total cholesterol (+0.26 vs +0.24mmol/L, p=0.88) showed no between-group difference at 6months.

Immunohistochemically, signet ring cells were negative for cytokeratin AE1/3, leukocyte common antigen, HMB-45, and CD34. Occasionally, isolated signet ring cells were positive for S-100 and melan A. Melanocytic nevus composed of signet ring cells should raise the differential diagnosis with other cutaneous tumors exhibiting signet ring cells.

Our goal was to generate a probe that could allow the visualization of specific activated DCs following either the immunization of mice with an antigen in adjuvant or an infection with leishmania major parasites. We thus tried to prepare a mAb reacting to the immunodominant LACK156-173 peptide of leishmania bound to I-Ad MHC class II molecules.  To this aim, we injected I-Ad/LACK recombinant dimers to TCR transgenic mice which exhibited an increased frequency of LACK-specific T cells. Four out of 600 supernatants, i.e. 2C44, 2F74, 2E60 and 2X8, readily stained LACK156-173-pulsed fibroblasts, but neither unpulsed fibroblasts nor OVA323-339-pulsed cells. BIAcore measurements yielded equilibrium dissociation constants ranging from 1.1 nM for 2C44 mAb to 120 nM for 2F74 mAb. To investigate whether these mAb could be used to detect APC presenting LACK in vivo, BALB/c mice were immunized or not with either LACK or OVA. LN cells were purified 2 days later, and stained with either 2C44, 2F74, 2E60 or 2X8 mAb. None of these mAb stained DC purified from non immunized mice. However, among the 4 mAb, only 2C44 could stain DC in LACK-immunized mice, but not in OVA-immunized mice. Furthermore, 2C44 stained DC from LACK-immunized mice expressing the H2-d haplotype but did not stain DC from LACK-immunized mice of other haplotypes. Thus, the 2C44 mAb allows for the detection of DC which captured and processed LACK in vivo. We next attempted to characterize the DC which carried I-Ad/LACK complexes at the cell surface in LACK-immunized BALB/c mice. Two different populations of DC, could thus be identified both expressing high levels of CD11c and MHC class II complexes but different levels of CD11b, suggesting that both Langerhans cells and dermal DC were actually presenting the LACK peptide. Following an intradermal immunization with LACK in adjuvant. We finally tried to purify these cells by cell sorting, using 2C44 mAb. In preliminary experiments we succeeded in purifying 300 000 cells from 5 immunized mice. 
Having characterized the antigen-presenting DC in immunized mice, we have now started to visualize and characterize the DC which carry I-Ad/LACK complexes at the cell surface in BALB/c mice infected by leishmania major.""" ;

We have been working in the attempt to overcome the limits in sample availability, exploiting the recent significant improvements of proteomic technology. The results allowed to lower the required sample amount significantly, an essential feature to analyze limited cell populations like dendritic cells. The group completed the measurements of murine dendritic cell subsets and established an in-depth proteomic map of them. These preliminary results show more than 4500 identified proteins in each subset. All of the known markers like CD11c, CD11b, DEC-205, Langerin, etc. were found according to their differential expression pattern.  Due to recent major developments in analysis software it is now possible to compare these subsets quantitatively based on the extracted ion current (XIC) and without any need of stable isotope labels. This software is still in development, but preliminary results show a high similarity of all there subsets in the steady state. 

Experiments have been performed to verify these differences in a biological point of view and analysis of the proteomic data itself using novel label-free software has also been completed. In 2008 our group showed the most comprehensive overview of molecular components in yeast (deGodoy et al.). However this study so far required SILAC (stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture) labelling leaving rare cell populations, like in vivo DC subsets, out of reach. In this work package we introduced a robust and generally applicable quantification technology, which allowed us to quantify the dendritic cell subset proteomes to a depth of more than 5000 proteins. Additionally, we were able to make functional predictions about closely related cell types using our large-scale proteomic data set. Biological follow up experiments fully confirmed our proteomic findings. Currently we are wrapping up our data for publication of the DC subset proteome and the quantitation software.  All our data can be accessed and analyzed through the MAPU database (Gnad et al.)

After finishing our proteomic study of steady-state dendritic cell we will now start to analyze proteomic changes of DC subsets after different stimuli. """ ;

      dc:description "Live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes (LM) is a promising bacterial vector able to induce a T-cell response to tumor-associated antigens and demonstrates great potential for use in vaccine development. A novel recombinant LM-based vaccine (Lmdd (LM ΔdalΔdat)-MPFG (multiple peptide fusing genes)) was developed with the ability to express and secrete hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-related tumor-associated antigens fragments due to the insertion of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-X protein (HBx)-derived epitopes HBx(52-60) and HBx(140-148), the universal T-helper epitope, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) epitope AFP(158-166), and melanoma antigen gene (MAGE)-3(271-279) into the HBV core protein. Following immunization with the Lmdd-MPFG vaccine, macrophages exhibited uptake of the bacteria; the vaccine was then nearly cleared 3 days after the first administration. It disappeared even more quickly following subsequent vaccinations. However, recombinant Lmdd-MPFG allowed for the full development of an antitumor response towards the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A0201 epitopes of MPFG. Each epitope stimulated an augmented T-cell proliferation and enhanced the supernatant level of interferon (IFN)-γ in vitro. In addition, IFN-γ-producing CD8(+) T cells as well as in vivo cytolytic activity were significantly increased in HLA-A2 transgenic mice. Additionally, the Lmdd-MPFG developed a strong antitumor response, as indicated by the significant resistance of immunized mice to MPFG-positive Hepa1-6 cell challenge in both a prophylactic and therapeutic setting. Tumor regression was accompanied by an enhanced cytotoxic T lymphocyte response and a decrease of regulatory T cells in the tumor. Collectively, these results suggest that utilizing attenuated LM as a vaccine vector, able to carry the MPFG gene, presents a potentially feasible strategy for prevention of HCC.Oncogene advance online publication, 19 September 2011; doi:10.1038/onc.2011.395." ;

The IFN?-ELISPOT analysis and proliferation with its accompanying cytokine production revealed a strong and broad vaccine-induced T cell response. The strength of the immune response (defined as breath and magnitude of the response) was significantly higher in the patients with a complete remission (CR) than in the patients with no changes (NC) in the lesion size. Phenotypical anlaysis revealed a strong induction of CD4+ T-cells specifically against HPV16 E6 and E7, whereas CD8+ T cells were found merely against HPV16 E6 and to a less broad array of epitopes within each patient. This analysis was done after one in vitro restimulation, however, by directly ex vivo flow cytometric analysis hardly any CD8+ T cell response could be detected. The T cell cultures obtained from the biopsies taken of the last vaccination site were found to be HPV16 peptides specific in 3/5 tested NR patients and in 4/5 tested CR. However, recognition of the recombinant HPV16 E6 and/or E7 protein was observed in 1/5 cultures from NR patients and 4/5 cultures of the CR patients, suggesting the differences in vaccine-induced T-cell reactivity. Tissue biopsies of the VIN lesion before and after vaccination showed only in one patient a HPV16-specific T-cell response, which was against HPV16 E6 and merely of the type 2 cytokine producing T cells. Notably, no T-cell cultures could be obtained from VIN biopsies taken from the CR patients. In conclusion, the HPV16 E6 and E7 synthetic long peptides vaccine is highly immunogenic, in that it increases the number and activity of HPV16-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells to a broad array of epitopes in all patients. The expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-specific T-cells, both considered to be important in the anti-tumor response indicates the immunotherapeutic potential of this vaccine. Addition of a strong toll-like receptor ligand might increase the CD8 response in frequency and to a broader set of epitopes.""" ;

This lectin, named DNGR-1, can serve as a receptor for antigen targetting to DC. Notably, tumour antigens coupled to anti-DNGR-1 antibodies and given together with a suitable adjuvant elicit potent CTL responses that can promote tumour regression. 

We will continue to explore the use of DNGR-1 as a tool for targeting antigens to DC in vivo. In particular, we will examine if such targeting in the absence of adjuvants allows induction of tolerance. We will further examine whether it can result in MHC class II presentation, allowing for manipulation of the CD4+ T cell compartment. """ ;

Depletion of natural regulatory T cells in tumor bearing mice resulted in rejection of P815 cells, but not EG7-OVA, suggesting that regulatory T cells have a stronger impact on immune responses against weakly immunogenic or auto-antigen (P1A). Treg are detected in growing P815 tumor and there is some evidence that 2 regulatory T cells develop sequentially. T cell activation was monitored by tetramer staining and in vivo CTL assay, and revealed strongly increased frequency of P1A-specific T cells after treatment with chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide, but not after T reg depletion. The histological analysis of progressive versus regressing tumors underscores the role of dendritic cells and Gr1+ cells (yet to be defined population) in tumor rejection. " ;

Our graduates are active throughout the globe, our professors at home on an international platform. The secret of our success comprises numerous components: competence in one's field of special interest; communicativity with associate departments; cross-curricular, transdisciplinary team spirit, alliances with professional practice. Unafraid of taking risks, we are breaking new scientific ground. Ingenuity and normality, ivory tower and workbench, lecture room and laboratory, traditional beer brewing and 'virtual reality' – the Technische Universität München nurtures all these features under its collective roof.

True to our origins, ever since the Technische Universität München was founded as a 'polytechnic school' at the heart of Europe in 1868, we have played an active role in transforming Bavaria from an agricultural state to a high-tech location. Rooted in this tradition we created a powerful international network. We are now an international university. One in every four undergraduates within a total student body of approximately 20,000 comes from abroad. The four-leaf clover symbolises our scientific spectrum: natural sciences, engineering sciences, medicine, life sciences.
 

In our capacity as an up-to-date entrepreneurial university, we pin our hopes on the vast range of human skills, identifying and sponsoring talent. We create teams by pooling new strengths. This leads to top performance and supports Corporate Identity.

Creative licence in the multifaceted world of science ranks high at the TU München. This particularly applies in the case of the TUM Institute for Advanced Study currently under development. It is based on the conviction that an atmosphere of creativity and inspiration, freedom and unbureaucratic support is the most productive source of progress for outstanding scientists.

One of our visions is the goal of becoming the most attractive technical university for women in Germany. With the help of unconventional measures, we want to create a seat of learning and a workplace that complies with the special needs of women and young families.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """The importance of alveolar macrophages and more recently DC in the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) has been well documented, but the relative contribution of plasmacytoid DC during bacterial infections is largely unknown. Thus, data was obtained on the contribution of pDC in acute MTb infection.

We examined whether plasmacytoid pDC are infected and/or activated by MTb, and whether they play a role in regulating bacterial clearance during acute MTb infection and if so how. We have compared these DC with myeloid DC and macrophages with respect to MTb infection. Flow cytometry analysis of CD11c populations in the lung and spleen during acute aerosol MTb infection showed no significant increase in plasmacytoid pDC; however during intravenous MTb infection the levels of plasmacytoid pDC appear to increase 43 days after infection. Lung CD4+ T cells increase after day 8 post aerosol infection as previously published by others. In addition, depletion of plasmacytoid pDC in vivo during acute intravenous MTb infection suggested that this DC subset plays a minimal role in regulating bacterial clearance during the primary immune response. In vitro MTb infection of BM myeloid DC and BM macrophages induced the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12p40 and TNF, as previously reported by others. In contrast, in vitro MTb infection of plasmacytoid pDC did not induce any detectable levels of cytokine. However, CpG stimulation of plasmacytoid pDC induced the cytokines IL-12p40, IL-12p70, TNF and IFN-alpha. Our data suggests that at this stage of infection plasmacytoid pDC may play only a limited role in protection against MTb infection. Our data however, does not address the possibility that plasmacytoid pDC may play a role during chronic infection when death of bacteria may be greater i.e. during memory responses or following antibiotic treatment, which may give release of un-methylated CpG DNA that could potentially activate plasmacytoid pDC via TLR-9, or in response to the virulent strain of MTB HN878 as described by Manca et al., 2001. Since in the mouse CpG stimulates IL-12 and TNF production by macrophages, myeloid and plasmacytoid DC, we also investigated a possible protective role for CpG in protection against MTB infection. We found that administration to mice with CpG could play a role in protection although this was very dependent on the time of administration, the dose of MTb used and the strain of mouse.

The in vitro studies on infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb)  of macrophages and DC have been discontinued. """ ;

General information

    The Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics Graduate Program leads to M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Molecular Biology and Genetics. The department is equipped with modern facilities for gene analysis, cell biology, protein chemistry, recombinant DNA technology and animal experiments. The education is research oriented. Research laboratories of the department are used for graduate student training a The main research activities of the department are on molecular genetics, molecular biology, molecular cell biology, molecular virology, structure-function relationship of proteins and new biotechnologies. The research laboratories of the department are equipped with facilities and equipment needed for gene analysis, protein chemistry, recombinant DNA technology, cell biology, experimental animal research, monoclonal antibody production and biotechnology. Current research programs are in the fields molecular genetics, molecular biology, cell biology, protein structure-function relationships, molecular virology and new biotechnologies. Genes involved in genetic predisposition to cancer and tumor suppression (p53, SMAD2, SMAD4, BRCA1, BRCA2, MLH1, MSH2) are studied in the Turkish population. The Molecular virology program concentrates on the viral etiology of chronic liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma (Hepatitis B and C viruses). Biological functions of proteins involved in tumor suppression (p33, p53, p73, p16, p130, BRCA1), apoptosis (bcl-2, bax, bcl-x), cell cycle (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, retinoblastoma family of proteins), DNA-damage response (p53, BRCA1, DNA-PK), cell-extracellular matrix interactions (syndecans) are studied. Regulation of gene transcription and cell signaling molecules are also studied. DNA- and antibody-based diagnostic tests for cancer and hepatitis viruses are developed. The department has established collaborative projects with national and international research institutions in Europe and The United States. TUBITAK-sponsored program allows selected Ph.D. students to perform long-term research training in foreign research institutions through collaborative research projects.""" ;

Over 60% of the University's RAE scores identified research as being of a level of international excellence.  This achievement has helped put Nottingham within the Sunday Times top ten UK universities.

The purpose of the RAE is to enable higher education funding bodies to distribute public funds for research based on the quality of research carried out at each institution.  The RAE gives quality ratings for research across all disciplines.  A scale ranges from 1 to 5* according to how much of the work is judged to reach national or international standards.

 At the end of 2005-6, the University announced a record £122 million of new research grants and contracts.  Awards for the current year are in line with this figure.  The University derives about 20% of its research income from industry sponsors, reflecting its strengths in taking promising new findings from bench to business.

The University's research strategy is based on the recruitment, promotion and retention of individuals with exceptional research credentials and a policy of encouraging research that crosses academic boundaries.  Collaboration with other international centres of research excellence is actively encouraged.

Significant investment in new research infrastructure at Nottingham is planned for the period 2007-9, which will further improve the quality of equipment and buildings to further the University's research aims.

The University pursues a co-ordinated approach to research management, with two Pro-Vice Chancellors for Research responsible for the University's research strategy through the Research Committee and its Research Strategy Groups.  Delivery of the strategy is the remit of the Research Innovation Services team, which is also responsible for maintaining the University's relationships with external funding organisations.

      dc:description "Genistein, 5,7,4'-trihydroxylisoflavone, a major component of soybean products, has been reported to possess anticancer activities. We examined the antitumor effects of 7-difluoromethoxyl-5,4'-di-n-octylgenistein (DFOG), a novel synthetic genistein derivative, on human ovarian cancer cells as well as the molecular mechanism. The growth-inhibitory effects of genistein and DFOG were determined using MTT assay and clonogenic assay in CoC1 and SKOV3 human ovarian cancer cells. Apoptotic activities of DFOG were observed using histone/DNA ELISA assay and flow cytometry with propidium iodide (PI) staining. Multiple molecular techniques, such as RT-PCR, western blot analysis, siRNA and cDNA transfection were used to explore the molecular mechanism. We demonstrated that nine of the genistein derivatives had a more effective antitumor activity than genistein. Among the afore-mentioned derivatives, DFOG presented with the strongest activity against CoC1 and SKOV3 cells in vitro. DFOG and genistein inhibited the growth of CoC1 and SKOV3 cells, accompanied by cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. DFOG caused apoptotic cell death with concomitant attenuation of Forkhead box protein M1 (FoxM1) and its downstream genes, such as survivin, cdc25B, cyclin B, and increased p27KIP1. Downregulation of FoxM1 by siRNA followed by DFOG treatment resulted in enhanced cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. Upregulation of FoxM1 by cDNA transfection attenuated DFOG-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptotic cell death. Our results show that the molecular role of FoxM1 in mediating the biological effects of DFOG and genistein in human ovarian cancer cells suggests that FoxM1 could be a novel target for the treatment of human ovarian cancer." ;

In correlation, we found a marked increase in cytolytic and IFN-gamma/tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) secreting CD8(+) T cells. Our data indicate that immature DCs genetically modified to express stimulating molecules can induce tumor antigen-specific T cells in vitro and could prove to be a significant improvement over DCs matured with the methods currently in use." ;

People come to LMU Munich seeking its unique academic diversity. Its 18 faculties give around 700 professors and 3,000 academic staff room to research and teach. They offer a wide and well-rounded range of learning opportunities that cover all areas, whether humanities and culture studies, law, economics and sociology, or medicine and the sciences.

Our research statistics speak for themselves: LMU Munich is part of 26 Collaborative Research Centers funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and is host university of 14 of them. It also hosts 9 DFG Research Training Groups and four international doctorate programs as part of the Elite Network of Bavaria. It attracts an additional 120 million euros per year in outside funding and is intensively involved in national and international funding initiatives. All this demonstrates why LMU Munich regularly gets top marks in national and international rankings.

With degree programs available in 150 subjects in numerous combinations, the array of courses we have to offer is extremely wide. Some 47,000 students, 16 percent of whom come to us from abroad, are currently taking advantage of these opportunities. They view their studies as an investment in the future, a launching pad for their later careers. We put our faith in imagination, open minds and creative intelligence.

LMU Munich takes the education of young people very seriously. When we speak of academic diversity, we also mean a comprehensive education that encompasses social skills alongside a critical awareness of values and history. This includes the Munich legacy of the Weisse Rose, the student-based resistance group that opposed Nazism.

Here we show that BRCA1/p220 silencing in normal human mammary epithelial (HME) cells reduces expression of two RNA-destabilizing proteins, namely AUF1 and pCBP2, both proteins bind and destabilize BRCA1-IRIS mRNA. BRCA1-IRIS overexpression in HME cells triggers expression of several TN/BL markers, e.g., cytokeratins 5 and 17, p-cadherin, EGFR and cyclin E as well as expression and activation of the pro-survival proteins; AKT and survivin. BRCA1-IRIS silencing in the TN/BL cell line, SUM149 or restoration of BRCA1/p220 expression in the mutant cell line, HCC1937 reduced expression of TN/BL markers, AKT and survivin and induced cell death. Collectively, we propose that BRCA1/p220 loss of expression or function triggers BRCA1-IRIS overexpression through a post-transcriptional mechanism, which in turn promotes formation of aggressive and invasive breast tumors by inducing expression of TN/BL and survival proteins." ;

Humanitas is also a teaching centre for the University of Milan’s degree in Medicine and Surgery, Nursing and Biotechnologies.

Humanitas is a hospital with an integrated highly specialised, multidisciplinary approach. From cardio surgery to orthopaedics, and from oncology to neurosurgery, Humanitas offers the highest international standards. The operating rooms are grouped in blocks near the Intensive Care Units. The surgical process has been designed to ensure perfect operating conditions, including guaranteed absolute environmental sterility.

Ever since it’s opening, Humanitas has adopted quality control systems based on the PDCA approach (Plan Do Check Act), which summarises the virtuous circle of quality and makes it possible to verify processes and outcomes in a continuous manner.
Istituto Clinico Humanitas has always compared itself with the best European hospitals and has taken part in various benchmarking projects as a means of preparing itself to meet the challenge of the opening of the European Health System.

      dc:description "Survivin and Bcl-2 are generally considered to be inhibitors of apoptosis and are frequently overexpressed in several types of human cancers. However, their role in regulating the biological behavior of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) remains controversial. We aimed to determine the expression of survivin and Bcl-2 and explore their correlation with clinicopathological features and prognosis. The expression of survivin and Bcl-2 proteins in 62 specimens of NSCLC tissues and 30 specimens of tumor adjacent tissues was detected using immunohistochemistry. The correlation between protein expression and clinicopathological features and prognosis was analyzed. The percentage of survivin-positive samples obtained from NSCLC tissues was 58.06% (36/62), which was significantly higher compared to that in normal lung tissues (10%, 3/30; P<0.05). Similarly, the percentage of Bcl-2-positive samples obtained from NSCLC tissues was statistically higher compared to that from normal lung tissues (51.61%, 32/62 vs. 6.67%, 2/30; P<0.05). Survivin expression was closely correlated with tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis and TNM stage (P<0.05), while Bcl-2 expression was only associated with TNM stage (P<0.05). The expression of survivin was positively correlated with that of Bcl-2 (P<0.05). A five-year follow-up study revealed that the expression of survivin and Bcl-2 was negatively correlated with post-operative survival duration. Our findings suggest that survivin and Bcl-2 may act synergistically in the occurrence, development, invasion and metastasis of NSCLC, both of which are up-regulated in NSCLC tissues. The co-expression of survivin and Bcl-2, which is closely related to malignancy, may serve as a biomarker for predicting prognosis." ;

Research at the institute focuses on studies of the relationship between the structure and the activity of biological systems with various degrees of complexity, i.e. nucleic acids as carriers of the genetic information and proteins or peptides as structural components of the three-dimensional organization of the cell. Their folding and function is likewise the subject of the research such as cell organelles, membranes, viruses, oncogenes, archaebacteria, higher cells and whole organisms. These serve as models for the investigation of the molecular bases of biological and pathophysiological phenomena: Cell-cell interactions, cell division, cell growth and - differentiation, gene regulation, signal transmission by nerves, photosynthesis, evolution and cancer. 

A special strength of the institute is the various methodical expertise in the areas of protein chemistry, molecular biology and structure analysis. Research in scientific departments and working groups is supported by central service facilities for DNA- and protein sequence analysis, DNA- and peptide-synthesis, NMR and mass spectrometry, a central library, an information retrieval and managing center, a computing center with bioinformatics unit, an animal house and central workshops. New methods in molecular biology and genetic engineering led to the development of a biomedically oriented basic research of molecular medicine. In this field of research medical questions are connected with molecular-biological techniques, which opens promising possibilities in the pathogenesis research and the development of new diagnostic and therapeutical approaches. The institute cooperates in this area with the pharmaceutical industry on national and international level. Several research groups of the institute are working on this medical orientated field of research, others are dealing with pure basic research. 

At the end of 2005 the institute had 880 employees (including people funded by third parties), of whom 492 were senior scientists and 214 were junior scientists .""" ;

Treatment

In the 400-bed hospital with its 124 statutory physicians, annually over 11,000 new patients are recruited, 130,000 patients attend its clinics and 42,000 patients receive treatment.
Research

Research is conducted by 400 research scientists under the oversight of a scientific council, a therapeutic trials commission and a clinical research committee.
Teaching

Over 5,000 hours of instruction are taught in its School of Oncology in collaboration with the University of Paris.

Each of these three missions is founded on principles that are the guiding force behind IGR's actions daily:
the excellence principle, through which efforts are united to establish quality standards in oncology;
the innovation principle, that is urgently needed for many cancers that are still incurable;
the evaluation principle, without which it is impossible to advance in a rigorous and methodical manner along the path to new therapies.

Situated in the heart of Europe, at the gateway to Paris, the Institute Gustave-Roussy is poised to undergo thorough restructuring and renovation at the beginning of the 21st century, to enhance its efficacy in its primary commitment towards patients, the fight against cancer.""" ;

      dc:description "Many studies which focus on the molecules and mechanisms related to the characteristics of the cancer have been performed. In particular, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are known to play a central role in the adhesion of cancer cells to vascular endothelial cells. In this study, the expression of CAMs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines was analyzed and correlated with the characteristics of various HCC cell lines. Eight human HCC cell lines were used in this study. We analyzed the expression of ICAM-1, E-selectin and the integrin subunits of HCC cell lines by western blot analysis and ELISA kit. We estimated the expression of integrin-α5 using western blot analysis and RT-PCR to compare the expression at the gene level with the protein level. In addition, we determined the expression of TGF-β1, as one of the markers for the cellular activity compared to the levels of expression with the expression of integrin-α3 and -α5. ICAM-1 was highly expressed in all of the cell lines except SNU398 and Hep3B, which exhibit a more aggressive nature among the studied HCC cell lines. E-selectin and integrin subunits varied in all HCC cell lines. In particular, integrin-β2 was highly expressed on all HCC cell lines. In conclusion, the levels of expression of the CAMs may not affect cellular activity, morphology or tumorigenicity. However, most HCC cell lines show various expressions of CAMs, suggesting that HCC cell lines expressing the major CAMs remain candidates for molecular targeted therapy, which may need to be patient-tailored for therapy according to the molecular profile." ;

      dc:description "The efficacy of islet transplantation is limited by poor graft vascularization. We herein demonstrated that microvesicles (MVs) released from endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) enhanced human islet vascularization. After incorporation into islet endothelium and beta-cells, EPC-derived MVs favored insulin secretion, survival and revascularization of islets transplanted in SCID mice. MVs induced in vitro islet endothelial cell proliferation, migration, resistance to apoptosis and organization in vessel-like structures. Moreover, MVs partially overcame the anti-angiogenic effect of rapamycin and inhibited endothelial-leukocyte interaction via L-selectin and CD40. MVs were previously shown to contain defined patterns of mRNAs. Here we demonstrated that MVs carried the pro-angiogenic miR-126 and miR-296 microRNAs (miRNAs). MVs pre-treated with RNase or derived from Dicer knocked-down EPCs showed a reduced angiogenic effect. In addition, MVs overcame the anti-angiogenic effect of the specific antagomiRs of miR-126 and miR-296, suggesting a relevant contribution of miRNAs delivered by MVs to islet endothelium. Microarray analysis of MV-stimulated islet endothelium indicated the up-regulation of mRNAs coding for factors involved in endothelial proliferation, differentiation and angiogenesis. In addition, MVs induced the activation of the PI3K-Akt and eNOS signaling pathways in islet endothelium. These results suggest that MVs activate an angiogenic program in islet endothelium that may sustain revascularization and beta-cell function." ;

      rdfs:comment """Array construction:

The yeast oligonucleotide array was constructed using the S. cerevisiae Genome Oligo Set ™ (Operon Technologies, CA, USA) composed of 6240 optimized oligonucleotides (70mers) each representing one yeast gene. 

Probe preparation and hybridization:

We used the indirect labeling method. Briefly, the reactive amine derivative of dUTP, 5-(3-
aminoallyl)-2?-deoxyuridine 5?-triphosphate (Sigma) was incorporated into cDNA using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo dT (Invitrogen) and random examers (Roche). After synthesis of cDNA (2–3 h at 42 °C), RNA was hydrolyzed by addition of sodium hydroxide and EDTA to a final concentration of 100 mM and 10 mM, respectively and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The hydrolysis reaction was neutralized with 1 M HEPES. After removing free nucleotides by purification and concentration using Microcon-30 microconcentrators, the aminoallyl-labeled samples were coupled to succinimidyl ester of cyanine-3 (Cy3) and cyanine-5 (Cy5) (Amersham) combined with 1 M NaHCO3, pH 9. Coupling took place in the dark at 25 °C for 1 h. Appropriate Cy3 and Cy5 labeled cDNA samples were purified following Qiagen Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit instructions. Poly-dA (12–18 mer), 20× SSC, and HEPES pH 7.0 were added. After the resultant mix was filtered through a Millipore 0.45 ?M filter, 10% SDS was added. The samples were incubated for 2 min at 100 °C and cooled in a microcentrifuge prior to loading and then applied to microarray. Incubation took place at 65 °C for 12–15 h. Hybridized slides were washed in a solution of water, 20× SSC, and 10% SDS, rinsed in water and 20× SSC, and dried via centrifugation for 2 min at 1000 rpm. 

Image acquisition:

The arrays were scanned immediately. Each comparison was performed in duplicate. Fluorescent cDNA bound to the microarray was detected with a GenePix 4000 microarray scanner (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), using the
GenePix 4000 software package to quantify microarray fluorescence. Intensity values were adjusted by subtracting surrounding background from spots. The median of spot intensities was corrected for background. To eliminate signals that are most prone to estimation error, any spot was excluded from analysis if both the Cy3 and Cy5 mean fluorescence signals were within two standard deviations of the mean background signals for that spot. This procedure avoids artificially inflated measurements of expression due to low signals. Additional to eliminating flagged spots, spots were also visually inspected and flawed ones discarded from the analysis. Data were normalized to mean ratio intensity. 

We can provide one experiment with 32 micorarrays, two experiments with 8 microarrays and one experiment with 12 micorarrays.""" ;

Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain SK1 (MATa/alpha HO gal2 cupS can1R BIO, Kane SM and Roth J. 1974 Bacteriol. 118: 8-14) was cultured in complete medium (YPD, 2% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 2% glucose) for 18 hours, then collected, washed twice with sterile water and resuspended at 108 cells/ml.  S. cerevisiae strains BY4741 (genotype, Mata his3delta1 leu2delta0 met15delta0 ura3delta0) and BY4741 och1 (Mata his3delta1 leu2delta0 met15delta0 ura3delta0 OCH1::kanMX4) were cultured in complete medium till exponentially phase and treated as before.

2 Spore stimuli
In order to test homogeneous yeast populations, pure spore cultures were obtained by using this strain whose sporulation efficiency is 100%. To prepare spores, cells were grown on YPD plates, replicated on SPOIV medium (2% potassium acetate, 0.25% yeast extract, 0,1% glucose) and sporulation was assessed by optical microscopy. Zymolyase (2 mg/ml) was used to digest ascum and liberate spores. We initially performed experiments to evaluate zymoliase sensitivity of asci for this specific strain and we assessed that 15 minutes incubation was the minimum time needed to damage the ascus, without touching the spore cell wall. Zymoliase was inactivated by heat (65°C for 2 minutes) and washed away carefully together with the remainings of the empty ascus, by resuspending twice the spore culture in 500 µl of distilled water centrifuging and discarding the supernatant; the spores were then resuspended to a concentration of 108 cells/ml. In order to exclude damage on the spore cell wall or effects on spore viability 100 µl of a culture of 1000 spores per ml was plated on YPD in triplicate, the spores showed 100% viability. The procedure used allows exposing DCs to the pure spore culture and to analyze the response to the spores alone, eliminating confounding effects of the presence of the ascus. Although from a mycological point of view the term ascospores might seem more appropriate than spores, we will use the term spores to specifically indicate that the effects we are observing are only due to the spores and not to the ascus. 
We observed that after 24 hours of culture in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO-BRL), spores were germinating and the exponentially growing cells were starting to divide. Therefore any analyses performed at later time points would be affected by this altered state, while no interference should be present until 24 hours. 

3 Candida albicans hyphae stimuli
Serotype A C. albicans strain SC5314 was cultured overnight in Saboraud medium at 28°C and then shifted to RPMI medium for 18 hours at 37°C to allow hyphal growth. The culture was treated as for yeast cells. After microscopical inspection of the purity of hyphal culture, this was treated as for yeast cells. It should be noted that in all the experiments performed in this study live microrganisms were used.""" ;
