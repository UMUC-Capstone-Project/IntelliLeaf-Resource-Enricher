Due to the opening of receptor-operated calcium channels, some cytokine receptors and G-protein coupled receptors induce an increase of intracellular calcium concentration upon activation. Calcium ion is a versatile intracellular secondary messenger that control many different cellular functions by changing its cytoplasmic concentration. A specific and complex network of signaling proteins recognizes intracellular calcium alterations to modulate cellular processes. Some reports have previously demonstrated that calcium also regulates hematopoiesis. This review examines the participation of intracellular calcium in hematopoiesis after the stimulus of various myeloid cytokines such as interleukin-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. In addition, the role of adenosine triphosphate and its receptors in inducing calcium increases during hematopoiesis is discussed. Lastly, the participation of this ion in myeloid proliferation and differentiation by cytokines and P2 receptors is also discussed." ;

      dc:description "Human Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection represents a major threat for heart transplant recipients (HTXs). CMV-specific T-cells effectively control virus infection and thus assessing antiviral immune recovery may have clinical utility in identifying HTXs at risk of infection. In this study 10 CMV-seropositive (R+) pre-transplant patients and 48 pre-emptive treated R+ HTXs were examined before and after 100 days post-transplant. Pre-emptive treatment is supposed to favor the immune recovery. CMV DNAemia and interferon-γ ELISPOT were employed to assess the viremia and immune reconstitution. HTXs could be categorized in three groups characterized by high (>100), medium (50-100) and low (<50) spot levels. Early identified high-responders efficiently controlled the infection and maintained high immunity levels also after 100 days after transplant. No episodes of grade ≥2R rejection occurred in the high-responders. Mid-responders were identified as a group with heterogeneous trends of immune reconstitution. Low-responders were respectively 41% and 21% of HTXs before and after 100 days post-transplant. Low responders were associated with higher incidence of infection. The effect of viremia on immune recovery was investigated: a statistical significant inverse correlation between magnitude of viremia and immune recovery emerged, in particular each tenfold increase in viremia (>4 log(10) DNAemia/ml) was associated to a 36% decrease of the ELISPOT. All episodes of high viremia (>4 log(10) DNAemia/ml) occurred during 1-60 days after transplant. Thus the concomitant evaluation of viremia and CMV immune reconstitution has clinical utility in identifying HTXs at risk of infection and may represent a helpful guide in making therapeutic choices." ;

For this purpose, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling was chosen because of its sensitivity and the possibility of further characterization of proliferating cells. The assay was optimized by selecting the best batch and concentration of fetal bovine serum, β-mercaptoethanol concentration, cell density, BrdU incubation time and antigen presenting cell type. Cats were vaccinated with the attenuated Nobivac vaccine Tricat and the peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation responses were quantified upon in vitro restimulation with inactivated and infectious feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), feline calicivirus (FCV) and felid herpesvirus 1 (FeHV-1). Proliferation signals were detected with inactivated FeHV-1 in the CD8(+) but not in the CD8(-) T lymphocyte population, with inactivated FCV and FPV in both CD8(-) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte populations. Restimulation with infectious FCV caused significant proliferation in the CD8(-) T lymphocyte population only while infectious FPV and FeHV-1 seemed to suppress lymphocyte proliferation in both T cell populations. Additional IFN-γ quantification in the culture supernatant revealed a large correlation between the proliferation signals and IFN-γ production, indicating that BrdU labeling is a very reliable technique to assess and characterize feline lymphoproliferative responses to viral antigens in vitro." ;

Whether probiotics can be used to interrupt the infectious process following initiation of infection was determined.Methods. C57BL/6 adult and neonatal mice were challenged with C. rodentium, and a probiotic mixture containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus rhamnosus was provided 1 week before bacterial challenge, concurrently with infection, or 3 days and 6 days after infection. Mice were sacrificed 10 days after infection, and disease severity was assessed by histological analysis and in vivo intestinal permeability assay. Inflammatory pathways and the composition of the fecal microbiome were assessed in adult mice.Results. Preadministration and coadministration of probiotics ameliorated C. rodentium-induced barrier dysfunction, epithelial hyperplasia, and binding of the pathogen to host colonocytes in adults, with similar findings in neonatal mice. Upregulated tumor necrosis factor α and interferon γ transcripts were suppressed in the pretreated probiotic group, whereas interleukin 17 transcription was suppressed with probiotics given up to 3 days after infection. Probiotics promoted transcription of interleukin 10 and FOXP3, and increased follicular T-regulatory cells in pretreatment mice. C. rodentium infection resulted in an altered fecal microbiome, which was normalized with probiotic intervention.Conclusions. This study provides evidence that probiotics can prevent illness and treat disease in an animal model of infectious colitis." ;

      rdfs:comment """We have obtained data from a phase I/II clinical trial of patients with end stage cervical cancer and of patients with vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) grade III.  Preclinical animal studies have shown that long peptides of 25-35 amino acids in length upon injection are only processed efficiently for MHC class I by dendritic cells in vivo. Long peptide injection is followed by appropriate cognate interactions between such DC, CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+ CTL precursors.

Three groups of end stage cervical cancer patients (in total N=35) were subcutaneously vaccinated with HPV16 E6 combined with or separated from HPV16 E7 overlapping long peptides in Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant, 4 times at three week intervals. Group 1 received 300 microgram per peptide at a single site, group 2 received 100 microgram per peptide of the E6 peptides in one limb, and 300 microgram per peptide of the E7 peptides in a second limb. Group 3 received separate injections of E6 and E7 peptides, each at a dose of 50 micrograms per peptide. The primary endpoint was to determine safety and toxicity of the HPV16 long peptide vaccine. In addition, the vaccine-induced T-cell response was assessed by IFN gamma-ELISPOT. No toxicity beyond grade II was observed during and after 4 vaccinations. In a few patients transient flu-like symptoms were observed. ELISPOT analysis of the vaccine-induced immune response revealed that co-injection of the E6 and E7 peptides resulted in a strong and broad T-cell response dominated by immunity against E6. Injection of the E6 and E7 peptides at two different sites increased the E7-response but did not affect the magnitude of the E6-induced immune response.

The HPV16 E6 and E7 long-peptide based vaccine is well tolerated and capable of inducing a broad IFN gamma-associated T-cell response, even in end stage cervical cancer patients. 5 out of 20 patients showed complete clearance of all VIN III disease and in 4 of these this was also associated with complete clearance of HPV16 virus. In conclusion, our peptide based vaccine is safe, elicits a strong and broad HPV16 specific T cell response, even under sub-optimal clinical conditions. We have now observed 9 months later, without further vaccination, that another 4 patients have achieved complete remission of all disease, confirmed by microscopy. Sustained benefit was observed in all 9 patients with complete remission of disease. This is also expected, because the 5 complete responders at 3 months after the last vaccination were also shown to be free of HPV16 at the site of the original vaccination. We conclude that this therapeutic vaccine trial caused complete disease regression in 9 out of 20 patients (45%), whereas spontaneous complete regression of VIN3 lesions occurs in less than 1.5% of patients. Another 6 patients had objective partial regressions of lesions 12 months after the last vaccination. At three months after vaccination there was a highly significant positive correlation between the strength of the interferon gamma and proliferative T cell response and the clinical response.  In summary, clinical benefit was observed in 15 out of 20 patients (75%). A paper describing these results has been submitted for publication. Preclinical evidence has shown that these long peptides act so well as a therapeutic vaccine, because only dendritic cells can efficiently process all potential epitopes from the long peptides and because concentrated antigen is offered to the immune system in the absence of antigenic competition. 


Additionally tissue biopsies of the last vaccination site and of the VIN lesion prior to the first vaccination and 3 months after the last vaccination were analysed for the presence of HPV16-specific T cells. The IFN?-ELISPOT analysis and proliferation with its accompanying cytokine production revealed a strong and broad vaccine-induced T cell response. The strength of the immune response (defined as breath and magnitude of the response) was significantly higher in the patients with a complete remission (CR) than in the patients with no changes (NC) in the lesion size. Phenotypical anlaysis revealed a strong induction of CD4+ T-cells specifically against HPV16 E6 and E7, whereas CD8+ T cells were found merely against HPV16 E6 and to a less broad array of epitopes within each patient. This analysis was done after one in vitro restimulation, however, by directly ex vivo flow cytometric analysis hardly any CD8+ T cell response could be detected. 

The T cell cultures obtained from the biopsies taken of the last vaccination site were found to be HPV16 peptides specific in 3/5 tested NR patients and in 4/5 tested CR. However, recognition of the recombinant HPV16 E6 and/or E7 protein was observed in 1/5 cultures from NR patients and 4/5 cultures of the CR patients, suggesting the differences in vaccine-induced T-cell reactivity. Tissue biopsies of the VIN lesion before and after vaccination showed only in one patient a HPV16-specific T-cell response, which was against HPV16 E6 and merely of the type 2 cytokine producing T cells. Notably, no T-cell cultures could be obtained from VIN biopsies taken from the CR patients.

In conclusion, the HPV16 E6 and E7 synthetic long peptides vaccine is highly immunogenic, in that it increases the number and activity of HPV16-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells to a broad array of epitopes in all patients. The expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-specific T-cells, both considered to be important in the anti-tumor response indicates the immunotherapeutic potential of this vaccine. Addition of a strong toll-like receptor ligand might increase the CD8 response in frequency and to a broader set of epitopes.

Conducting a new clinical trial in which the peptide vaccination is combined with the application of Aldara? on the vaccination site in order to induce a strong CD4+ but more importantly a CD8+ T cell response, which can be detected directly ex vivo.

      dc:description "BACKGROUND: The squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) is widely used as a serological biomarker for various cancers. There are two known SCCA molecules, SCCA1 and SCCA2. We previously found that interleukin-4 or interleukin-13, two related Th2-type cytokines that play an important role in allergic diseases, induce expression of SCCA1 and SCCA2. In this study, we examined whether combined measurements of SCCA1 and SCCA2 are useful for diagnosing atopic dermatitis (AD). METHODS: We established new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to specifically detect SCCA1 or SCCA2. We applied serum samples from AD patients with food allergies and from cervical cancer patients to these ELISAs. We performed receiver operating characteristic analyses to diagnose AD and to distinguish AD from cervical cancer. RESULTS: Serum concentrations of both SCCA1 and SCCA2 were elevated in AD patients. The serum concentrations of SCCA1 and SCCA2 positively correlated with the clinical severity of AD, showing high specificity (0.86-0.88) and sensitivity (0.86) against control donors. The serum concentrations of SCCA1 and SCCA2 were elevated in cervical cancer patients; however, the SCCA2/SCCA1 ratios clearly distinguished AD patients from cervical cancer patients with high specificity (0.87) and sensitivity (0.87). Expression of SCCA2 was predominant in AD patients, whereas cervical cancer patients showed a predominance of SCCA1. CONCLUSIONS: Combined measurements of SCCA1 and SCCA2 are very useful in estimating the severity of allergic diseases, making it possible to distinguish allergic diseases from cancers." ;

The immune response to ranavirus infection has been studied in amphibians, but little is known about the responses elicited in piscine hosts. In this study, the immune response and apoptosis induced by ranaviruses were investigated in fish epithelial cells. Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells were infected with four different viral isolates: epizootic haematopoietic necrosis virus (EHNV), frog virus 3 (FV3), European catfish virus (ECV) and doctor fish virus (DFV). Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays were developed to measure the mRNA expression of immune response genes during ranavirus infection. The target genes included tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), β2-microglobulin (β2M), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). All ranaviruses elicited changes in immune gene expression. EHNV and FV3 caused a strong pro-inflammatory response with an increase in the expression of both IL-1β and TNF-α, whereas ECV and DFV evoked transient up-regulation of regulatory cytokine TGF-β. Additionally, all viral isolates induced increased β2M expression as well as apoptosis in the EPC cells. Our results indicate that epithelial cells can serve as an in vitro model for studying the mechanisms of immune response in the piscine host in the first stages of ranavirus infection." ;

      rdfs:comment """Our lab obtained data on the ability of NK cell IFN-gamma production to predict long term survival in advanced GISTs treated with IM.

Background: Mutant isoforms of the KIT or PDGF receptors expressed by gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are considered the therapeutic targets for imatinib mesylate (IM) (Gleevec®, Novartis), a specific inhibitor of these tyrosine kinase receptors. Predictive factors for the response to IM pertain to the intrinsic features of GIST tumor cells but not to the host. Besides its direct antiproliferative activity on tumor cells, IM can trigger NK cell effectors which contribute to tumor regression in mice. 

Therefore, we addressed whether NK cell functions could be independent prognostic factors predicting long term survival to IM therapy.

Methods: The functional phenotype of NK cells was followed up in 77 GIST patients enrolled in two Phase III trials from 2 institutions testing dosing or duration of IM administration (EORTC 62005 and BFR14 trials). “Immunological responders” were defined as patients whose NK cell IFN-gamma values after 2 months of IM were higher or equal to the baseline value at entry in the trial. The prognostic impact of IFN-gamma on progression-free survival was assessed by a Wald test in a Cox regression analysis using the landmark method and stratified by trial and on the c-kit mutational status. 

Results: 
56 patients were evaluable for the NK cell IFN-gamma responses at baseline and 2 months. Their median follow-up for progression-free survival was 3.7 years. 34/56 patients were “immunological responders” to IM. In the Cox regression analysis stratified by trial, immunological responders possessed a hazard ratio of progression or death equal to 0.29 (95% CI [0.12-0.70], p=0.006) as compared to non-responders. Kaplan-Meier two-year survival estimates were 85% for immunological responders and 50% for non-responders. Moreover, the immunological response added prognostic value to the c-kit mutation. 

Conclusion: 
The NK cell IFN-gamma production after two months of treatment could be considered as an independent predictor of long term survival in advanced GISTs treated with IM.""" ;

In this study we examined the relationship between CRP and markers of neuronal integrity and cerebral metabolism in middle-aged adults with intact cognitive function, using proton magnetic resonance spectrocospy. We hypothesized that increased levels of circulating CRP would correlate with changes in brain metabolites indicative of early brain vulnerability. Thirty-six individuals, aged 40 to 60, underwent neuropsychological assessment, a blood draw for CRP quantification, and (1)H MRS examining N-acetyl-aspartate, myo-inositol, creatine, choline, and glutamate concentrations in occipito-parietal grey matter. Independent of age, sex and education, serum CRP was significantly related to higher cerebral myo-inositol/creatine ratio (F(4,31) = 4.74, P = 0.004), a relationship which remained unchanged after adjustment for cardiovascular risk (F(5,30) = 4.356, CRP β = 0.322, P = 0.045). Because these biomarkers are detectable in midlife they may serve as useful indicators of brain vulnerability during the preclinical period when mitigating intervention is still possible." ;

      dc:description "BACKGROUND: Trauma and transfusion can both alter immunity, and while transfusions are common among traumatically injured patients, few studies have examined their combined effects on immunity. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We tracked the plasma levels of 41 immunomodulatory proteins in 56 trauma patients from time of injury up to 1 year later. In addition, a murine model was developed to distinguish between the effects of transfusion and underlying injury and blood loss. RESULTS: Thirty-one of the proteins had a significant change over time after traumatic injury, with a mixed early response that was predominantly anti-inflammatory followed by a later increase in proteins involved in wound healing and homeostasis. Results from the murine model revealed similar cytokine responses to humans. In mice, trauma and hemorrhage caused early perturbations in a number of the pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators measured, and transfusion blunted early elevations in interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and interferon-γ. Transfusion caused or exacerbated changes in monocyte chemotactic protein-1, IL-1α, IL-5, IL-15, and soluble E-selectin. Finally, trauma and hemorrhage alone increased CXCL1 and IL-13. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides a detailed characterization of the major shift in the immunologic environment in response to trauma and transfusion and clarifies which immune mediators are affected by trauma and hemorrhage and which by transfusion." ;

      rdfs:comment """Attenuated Expression of A20 Markedly Increases the Efficacy of Double Stranded RNA-Activated Dendritic Cells as an Anti-Cancer Vaccine

A20 is a zinc finger protein with ubiquitine-modifying activity.  It has been described that A20 negatively regulates signaling induced by the tumor necrosis factor receptor and toll like receptor (TLR) family in a number of cell types, including mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs).  However, the expression and effect of A20 in activated monocyte-derived DCs have not been previously evaluated.  We report that DCs activated with the TLR3 ligand poly(I:C), upregulate A20.  Downregulating A20 demonstrated its role in the functional activation of DCs.  A20 downregulated DCs showed higher activation of the transcription factors nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), which resulted in increased and sustained production of interleukin (IL) -6, IL-10 and IL-12p70.  We additionally silenced the immunosuppressive IL-10 and demonstrated that IL-10 inhibits T cell proliferation.  We further demonstrated that A20 downregulated DCs skew naive CD4+ T cells towards IFN-g producing T helper 1 cells, a process which is dependent on IL-12p70 and which is unaffected by IL-10.  Furthermore, A20 and/or IL-10 downregulated DCs had an enhanced capacity to prime Melan-A/MART-1 specific CD8+ T cells.  Finally, we demonstrated that potent T cell stimulatory DCs are generated by the simultaneous delivery of poly(I:C12U), A20 or A20/IL-10 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and antigen-encoding mRNA, introducing a one step approach to improve DC-based vaccines.  Together these findings demonstrate that A20 negatively regulates NF-kB and AP-1 in DCs and that silencing of A20 results in DCs with enhanced T cell stimulatory capacity.

The generated DC will be clinically tested.""" ;

      dc:description "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been suggested to exploit interleukin-10 (IL-10) to suppress immune defense of infected pigs. The present study constructed plasmids encoding selected short hairpin RNA specific to porcine IL-10 mRNA (pIL-10sh) to knockdown IL-10 transcription and investigated the suppressive effect of PRRSV-induced IL-10 on various immune marker expressions. Naïve blood monocytes from eight PRRSV-seronegative pigs were transfected with pIL-10sh and pNeg (plasmid vector) prior to PRRSV inoculation and subsequent lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. The mRNA expressions of IL-10, IL-1β, IL-12p40, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interferon gamma (IFNγ), transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), CD80, and CD86 were evaluated by real-time PCR. The IL-10, TNFα, and IFNγ protein productions were determined by ELISA. Compared with non-transfected monocyte control, transfection with selected pIL-10sh (pIL-10sh1), but not other pIL-10sh nor pNeg, significantly reduced IL-10 expression and significantly enhanced TNFα and IFNγ expressions. Slight increases in IL-1β, IL-12p40, CD80, and CD86 expressions were also observed. Neither pIL-10sh1 nor pNeg transfection affected TGFβ expression. Our results indicate that PRRSV does exploit IL-10 to suppress the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly TNFα and IFNγ, and co-stimulatory molecules, CD80 and CD86." ;

These patients are being vaccinated with cytokine cocktail matured DCs electroporated with mRNA encoding Tat, Rev and Nef.  The cDNA’s encoding these early expressed HIV antigens have been human codon optimized and modified with lysosomal targeting sequences.  Four vaccines separated by 4 weeks.  Two weeks after the 4th vaccine, an analytical HAART interruption was started. So far, 17 patients have been included in this study.  

Background:
The limitations of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) have necessitated the development of alternative therapeutic strategies. One of the approaches that has gained prominence in recent years is therapeutic vaccination. We decided to assess the capacity of mature dendritic cells, derived from blood monocytes of HIV-1 infected patients, to generate functional T-cell responses. For this purpose, we constructed a chimeric mRNA encoding the proteins Tat, Rev and Nef. The TaReNef encoding information was linked to the HLA class II-targeting sequence of DC-LAMP. Broadly directed HIV-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells exhibiting a poly-functional cytokine secretion pattern were generated by co-culturing with autologous chimeric mRNA electroporated dendritic cells. Thus, administration of ex vivo generated dendritic cells expressing the early proteins Tat, Rev and Nef might offer a promising approach for therapeutic vaccination in HIV-1 infection.

However, selective transfection of neuronal cells or specific brain regions remains a problem. In the present study, we show that the RVG peptide can efficiently be used as shuttle system to transfect neuronal cells with cdk4 siRNA leading to selective knockdown of cdk4 expression in vitro and in vivo. After transfection, cdk4 expression was reduced up to 75% in Neuro2A cells. Stereotactically injected RVG peptide delivered cdk4 siRNA specifically to neurons in the hippocampus, resulting in a specific knockdown of cdk4 expression up to 400 µm from the injection site. Further complexation studies of RVG peptide with larger molecules such as plasmid vectors or DNA fragments were also successfully performed and improved in vitro. Therefore, the peptide is not only a highly promising drug delivery system for siRNA and potentially other therapeutic molecules, but also a powerful tool to systematically analyze gene function in the brain under experimental settings in correlation to neurodegenerative disorders." ;

      dc:description "Background. The association between combination antiretroviral (cARV) therapy use by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women during pregnancy and risk of prematurity is still controversial. We explored this question, focusing on the initiation of ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (PIs) during pregnancy, which is now standard care.Methods. Trends in prematurity (<37 gestational weeks) were studied among all singleton pregnancies in the Agence Nationale de Recherche sur le SIDA (ANRS) French Perinatal Cohort from 1990 through 2009 (n = 13 271). In-depth analysis was conducted in a more detailed substudy of the cohort, among women starting PI-based ARV therapy during pregnancy (n = 1253). Multivariable analysis adjusted for immunovirological status and known risk factors for prematurity.Results. Prematurity increased from 9.2% during 1990-1993 (no therapy) and 9.6% during 1994-1996 (mostly zidovudine monotherapy) to 12.4% during 1997-1999 (dual-nucleoside analog therapy) and 14.3% during 2005-2009 (routine cARV therapy; P < .01). Prematurity was associated with cARV therapy, compared with zidovudine monotherapy, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.69 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-2.07; P < .01) when accounting for maternal age, intravenous drug use, geographic origin, and CD4 cell count. During 2005-2009, the prematurity rate was higher with boosted than with nonboosted PI therapy started during pregnancy (14.4% vs 9.1% [P = .05]; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.03 [95% CI, 1.06-3.89; P = .03] in multivariate analysis). The difference concerned mainly induced preterm delivery for maternal or fetal indications (5.6% vs 1.6%; P = .02),Conclusions. The prematurity rate among HIV-infected pregnant women was twice that in the general population in France; this was not entirely explained by sociodemographic characteristics. Prematurity was independently associated with cARV therapy and, particularly, with the initiation of ritonavir-boosted PI therapy during pregnancy." ;

      dc:description "OBJECTIVE:To report the long-term safety and efficacy results from CAMMS223 comparing alemtuzumab with interferon β-1a in early, active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). What are the long-term effects of alemtuzumab treatment, received 36 to 48 months previously, on relapse and disability in early, active RRMS? This study provides evidence of the effectiveness of alemtuzumab in reducing the relapse rate and accumulation of disability compared with interferon β-1a (IFNβ-1a) through extended follow-up (up to 60 months from baseline). METHODS:Of 334 patients originally randomized, 198 participated in the extension phase (151 [68%] alemtuzumab and 47 [42%] IFNβ-1a). Disability, relapses, and safety were assessed as in the original study period. Efficacy outcomes were analyzed from baseline of the original trial period to 60 months. Safety data extended beyond 60 months. RESULTS:Over 5 years, alemtuzumab lowered the risk of sustained accumulation of disability by 72% and the rate of relapse by 69% compared with IFNβ-1a (both p < 0.0001). The annualized relapse rate from baseline to month 60 was 0.11 for alemtuzumab and 0.35 for IFNβ-1a. Complete safety follow-up reflected 988 and 376 person-years for alemtuzumab and IFNβ-1a patients, respectively. Serious infections were seen in 7% of alemtuzumab patients and 3% of IFNβ-1a patients, and thyroid disorders were seen in 30% of alemtuzumab patients vs 4% of IFNβ-1a patients. Immune thrombocytopenia occurred in 3% of alemtuzumab patients and 0.9% of IFNβ-1a patients during the initial study period; no additional events were reported during the extension phase. One alemtuzumab patient developed Goodpasture disease 39 months after the second annual cycle of alemtuzumab. CONCLUSIONS:Through extended follow-up, alemtuzumab remained significantly more efficacious than IFNβ-1a, with a safety profile consistent with previous reports.Classification of Evidence:This study provides Class III evidence that alemtuzumab is more effective than interferon β-1a in reducing relapses and disability in patients with RRMS in a long-term follow-up of a rater-blinded, randomized clinical trial with 59.5% of patients participating in the extended follow-up period." ;

The pathogenesis of NEC is characterized by an intestinal epithelial injury caused by perinatal insults, leading to the activation of the mucosal innate immune system and exacerbation of the epithelial barrier damage. Cytokines play an important role in mucosal immunity. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that has been shown to play a role in epithelial integrity and modulation of the mucosal immune system. We hypothesized that IL-10 may protect against the development of experimental NEC by blunting the inflammatory response in the intestine." ;

For this purpose we used multimers kindly provided by Pierre Coulie (Brussels) together with surface markers (such as CD8, CD4, CD3, CD45RA, CCR7, CD25, CD27, CD137, CD127) in different 8-color panels on the BD FACSCanto II. Additionally we used functional markers such as CD107a and intracellular cytokine staining for the further analysis of individual T-cell populations and T-cell clones.

Monitoring of the ongoing vaccination trial with RNA transfected autologous DC was done with overlapping peptides covering the whole protein sequence of the tumor antigens MageA3, MelanA and Survivin. With this approach we monitored the immune responses of 8 vaccinated patients and of more than 15 other stage IV melanoma patients. Results showed broad preexisting T-cell responses in some patients and de novo immune reactivity in 3 vaccinated patients. The fine specificity of these immune responses needs to be further defined. 

Demonstration that defined re-stimulation Elispot correlates very well with MPLC assay.""" ;

      dc:description "OBJECTIVE: This study focused on the characterization of stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) in comparison with dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) to certify SHED as a key element in tissue engineering. METHODS: In the present study, SHED and DPSCs were assayed for their cell surface antigens and proliferation by measuring the cell cycles, growth rates, Ki67-positive efficiencies, and colony-forming units (CFUs). The evaluation of multi-differentiation was performed using alizarin red and oil red O and real-time PCR in vitro. The mineralization capability of the cells was examined in vivo by implanting with ceramic bovine bone (CBB) into subcutaneous of immunocompromised mice for 8weeks. A three-dimensional pellet cultivation system is proposed for SHED and DPSCs to recreate the biological microenvironment that is similar to that of a regenerative milieu. RESULTS: SHED showed a higher proliferation rate and differentiation capability in comparison with DPSCs in vitro, and the results of the in vivo transplantation suggest that SHED have a higher capability of mineralization than the DPSCs. The mRNA expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, including matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were higher in SHED than that in DPSCs. In addition, the expression levels of Col I and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in SHED sheets were significantly higher than those in DPSCs sheets. CONCLUSIONS: This study systematically demonstrated the differences in the growth and differentiation characteristics between SHED and DPSCs. Consequently, SHED may represent a suitable, accessible and potential alternative source for regenerative medicine and therapeutic applications." ;

      dc:description "ABSTRACT: Immunotherapy using autologous T cells has emerged to be a powerful treatment option for patients with metastatic melanoma. These include the adoptive transfer of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), T cells transduced with high-affinity T cell receptors against major tumor antigens, and T cells transduced with chimeric antigen receptors composed of hybrid immunoglobulin light chains with endodomains of T-cell signaling molecules. Among these and other options for T-cell therapy, TILs together with high-dose interleukin 2 have had the longest clinical history with multiple clinical trials in centers across the world consistently demonstrating durable clinical response rates near 50% or more. A distinct advantage of TIL therapy making it still the T-cell therapy of choice is the broad nature of the T-cell recognition against both defined and undefined tumors antigens against all possible major histocompatibility complex, rather than the single specificity and limited major histocompatibility complex coverage of the newer T cell receptors and chimeric antigen receptor transduction technologies. In the past decade, significant inroads have been made in defining the phenotypes of T cells in TIL-mediating tumor regression. CD8+ T cells are emerging to be critical, although the exact subset of CD8+ T cells exhibiting the highest clinical activity in terms of memory and effector markers is still controversial. We present a model in which both effector-memory and more differentiated effector T cells ultimately may need to cooperate to mediate long-term tumor control in responding patients. Although TIL therapy has shown great potential to treat metastatic melanoma, a number of issues have emerged that need to be addressed to bring it more into the mainstream of melanoma care. First, we have a reached the point where a pivotal phase II or phase III trial is needed in an attempt to gain regulatory approval of TILs as standard of care. Second, improvements in how we expand TILs for therapy are needed that minimize the time the T cells are in culture and improve the memory and effector characteristics of the T cells for longer persistence and enhanced anti-tumor activity in vivo. Third, there is a critical need to identify surrogate and predictive biomarkers to better select suitable patients for TIL therapy to improve response rate and duration. Overall, the outlook for TIL therapy for melanoma is very bright. We predict that TILs will indeed emerge to become an approved treatment in the upcoming years through pivotal clinical trials. Moreover, new approaches combining TILs with targeted signaling pathway drugs, such as mutant B-RAF inhibitors, and synergistic immunomodulatory interventions enhancing T-cell costimulation and preventing negative regulation should further increase therapeutic efficacy and durable complete response rates." ;

The procedure allows a user to compare his/her microarray data to the corpus of public immunology experiments stored in DC-BASE using pathway signatures. The procedure is made up by several steps.

1.Raw data normalization: the user uploads raw data (Affymetrix or Illumina gene expression platforms are supported) and select the species. Upon succesful upload, raw data is normalized using a standard procedure.

2.Comparison selection: The user is then asked to select which samples correspond to the treatment group, and which to the control group. Subsequently, the user has to select which treated-untreated comparisons to make (using single sample). The pipeline takes these information and combines them with the normalized data to create treated-reference paired ratios corresponding to all comparisons the user has selected.

3.Generation of pathway signatures: the pipeline takes the produced ratios and runs a Fisher's Exact Test analysis over a pathway set of 82 immunologically-related pathways, obtaining signed p-values for each of the pathway in the set (positive indicates up-regulation, negative down-regulation). Those p-values are then converted into a “pathway signature” for each comparison: each p-value for a specific pathway under a threshold (0.05) is converted to either 1 (up-regulated), -1 (down-regulated), or 0 if above the threshold.

4.Similarity assessment: a matrix containing all the signatures for all the pathways is compared with the signatures calculated from the DC-BASE experiments using a  method known as clustering with multiscale bootstrap resampling. The result is a clustering image in PDF format (downloadable by the user)  which shows the pathway activation state for all the samples and which indicates very similar samples with red branches in the clustering tree. The user can also download the table used for clustering to use it with other programs.""" ;

      dc:description "Bladder cancer is a common cancer with particularly high recurrence after transurethral resection. In this study, we investigated the prognostic value of the protein expression of cathepsin E, maspin, polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), and survivin in patients with stage Ta and T1 urothelial carcinomas. Transcripts from the four genes encoding these proteins were previously included in gene expression signatures for outcome prediction for Ta/T1 bladder cancer. We used three different tissue microarrays with 693 non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinomas from Danish, Swedish, and Spanish patient cohorts with long-term follow-up. Protein expression was measured by immunohistochemistry, and antibody specificity was validated by Western blotting. In the Danish patient cohort, we found the expression of cathepsin E, maspin, Plk1, and survivin to be significantly associated with progression to stage T2 to T4 bladder cancer (for each marker: log-rank test; P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified cathepsin E (P < 0.001), Plk1 (P = 0.021), maspin (P = 0.001), and survivin (P = 0.001) as independent prognostic markers. Furthermore, maspin, survivin, and cathepsin E expression significantly subgrouped patients already stratified by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer risk scores. Finally, we successfully validated the results in tumors from 410 patients from both Sweden and Spain. We conclude that all four protein markers may have prognostic value in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer for guiding optimal treatment of patients. Additional prospective studies are needed for further validation of the clinical relevance of this marker panel." ;

      dc:description "Dendritic cells (DC) play a key role in regulating immune responses and are the best professional antigen-presenting cells. Two major DC populations are defined in part according to cell surface CD11c expression levels. Unexpectedly, we observed that mouse DC strongly down-regulate the typical DC marker CD11c upon activation. To better characterize DC responses, we have analyzed CD11c expression on mouse and human myeloid DC after Toll-like receptor (TLR) triggering. Here we show that mouse bone marrow-derived DC (BMDC) as well as spleen DC down-regulate cell surface CD11c upon activation by TLR3/4/9 agonists. In all cases, full DC activation was reached, as determined by cytokine secretion, cell stimulation in mixed leukocyte reactions (MLR), and CD40/CD86/major histocompatibility complex (MHC) up-regulation. Interestingly, membrane CD11c down-regulation correlated with increased cytoplasmic pools of CD11c. In contrast to the up-regulation of CD40 and MHC class II molecules, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced CD11c down-regulation was MyD88-dependent. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), which does not signal through MyD88, also induced cell surface CD11c down-regulation. Notably, CD11c down-regulation was not observed upon activation of human DC, either through TLR-dependent or -independent cell activation. Thus, activated mouse DC may be transiently CD11c-negative in vivo, hampering the identification of those cells. On the other hand, cell surface CD11c down-regulation may serve as a new activation marker for mouse DC." ;

      dc:description "Since 1960, different classes of immunosuppressive drugs have been used in the post-transplant follow-up. Each is assessed for its effectiveness in preventing rejection but also on the basis of the many side effects induced by prolonged treatment. To reduce these side effects, continuous development of knowledge and medical technology to create cutting-edge therapies in the field is necessary. One of these is extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP), an immunomodulatory therapy approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1988 for the treatment of advanced forms of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. EC P is a useful therapeutic tool for the development of immunomodulation supported by CD8+ clone-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes. The T cells targeted by EC P are modified by photoactivation and seem to develop marked immunogenicity with no suppression of the immune response. Recent studies suggest the possible utility of EC P in the treatment of glomerulonephritis and in countering rejection after transplantation of organs including the kidney." ;

      dc:description "Lymphocytotropic mouse parvoviruses can perturb immune responses. For example the recently identified mouse parvovirus designated MPV-1 persistently infects lymphoid tissues and interferes with the ability of cloned T cells to proliferate. As a consequence of these findings the present studies were undertaken to characterize further the immunomodulatory effects of MPV-1 on T cell-mediated immune responses in vivo and in vitro. To evaluate the effect of MPV-1 on CD8+ T cell-mediated responses sarcoma I (SaI) cells, devoid of class II major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens, were administered to MPV-1-infected adult BALB/c mice. MPV-1 infection accelerated tumor allograft rejection. Immunofluorescence staining and in situ hybridization studies of tumors suggested that direct infection of the tumor cells was not responsible for accelerated rejection. Furthermore, compared with uninfected mice, T cells from infected mice that had rejected SaI tumors had a diminished cytolytic capacity. Taken together these results suggest that MPV-1 may induce \"bystander help.\" To examine the in vivo effect of MPV-1 on CD4+ T cell mediated responses adult mice were primed with ovalbumin (OVA) and infected with MPV-1. Spleen and popliteal lymph node cells from OVA-primed mice 3 or 7 days after MPV-1 inoculation had reduced proliferation responses, whereas the proliferative capacity of mesenteric lymph node cells from these mice was increased. Similarly, MPV-1 reduced cytokine-induced proliferation of allospecific CD8+ cloned L3 T cells and OVA-reactive CD4+ T cells without effecting cell viability. Since parvoviruses are widespread among laboratory rodents, these findings emphasize the importance of identifying and excluding parvovirus infections in mice used for transplantation studies and in cultures of mouse T lymphocytes." ;

      rdfs:comment """We have been developing the DC-ATLAS DC-pathway database. For this, we have set about identifying key signalling pathways that were likely to be of most relevance to dendritic cell functions. We have designed a DC-ATLAS data model to effectively describe pathways, their genes, and their interaction. We produced a controlled vocabulary that contains at least 400 ontological terms, prepared on the basis of the proposals and discussions among the researchers involved in DC-ATLAS project. We defined the pathway representation where each pathway was described using three different means: a PDF format, a gene list, and a graphical representation. The pathways data model and controlled vocabulary was developed in collaboration with Sorin Draghici and the Leaf Bioscience group lead by A. Splendiani.

DC ATLAS integrates the signalling modules of the DC, curating specifically 
(i) the pathways leading from immature dendritic cells to mature dendritic cells, and 
(ii) the pathways depending on interaction between different cell types (e.g. DC and T cells interaction, leading to Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg polarisation, and apoptosis). 

Given the complexity of the problem we have built a unique group of curators with the primary purpose of describing separately: 
(1) the section of the pathway sensing the stimulus and transmitting the stimulus to the general signal transduction pathway; 
(2) the principal signal transduction modules used by the DC; and 
(3) the outcomes (e.g. cytokine production, apoptosis, migration, differentiation). 

From over 200 pathways, a list of some 30-40 was prioritised for immediate attention. These were then assigned to individual curators, drawn from across the Network and including some of its Third Parties. Among the curated pathways are TCR/ slam receptor; PPAR P PPAR Gamma; TCR Ag proc/pres; TLR4; TLR7+8; TLR 2 + 1; TLR6+2; MHC1 MHC2 pathways- antigen presentation; TLR3; DC-Sign; TLR 5+; TCR – motility; Dectin-1.

The curation process revealed substantial inaccuracies and errors in publicly-available databases. For the first time, this initiative clarified differences between homologous pathways operating in dendritic cells from human versus mouse (and other species), and in dendritic cells from different sources (e.g. human monocytes-derived versus mouse bone marrow-derived DC, and different primary DC subsets). Draft manuscripts, describing this initiative and its first results were prepared and will be submitted as DC-THERA joint publications.

The most common anticipated usage is to identify an RDF schema, given a name for one of the properties or classes defined by that schema. Although XML namespace declarations will typically provide the URI where RDF vocabulary resources are defined, there are cases where additional information is required. 

For example, constructs such as 
<rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/Creator\"/>
do not indicate the URI of the schema that includes the vocabulary item Creator (i.e., http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/). 

In such cases, the rdfs:isDefinedBy property can be used to explicitly represent that information.

      dc:description "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major worldwide health problem. The only vaccine against TB, Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), has demonstrated relatively low efficacy and does not provide satisfactory protection against the disease. More efficient vaccines and improved therapies are urgently needed to decrease the worldwide spread and burden of TB, and use of a viable, metabolizing mycobacteria vaccine may be a promising strategy against the disease. Here, we constructed a recombinant Mycobacterium smegmatis (rMS) strain expressing a fusion protein of heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HBHA) and human interleukin 12 (hIL-12). Immune responses induced by the rMS in mice and protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) were investigated. Administration of this novel rMS enhanced Th1-type cellular responses (IFN-γ and IL-2) in mice and reduced bacterial burden in lungs as well as that achieved by BCG vaccination. Meanwhile, the bacteria load in M. tuberculosis infected mice treated with the rMS vaccine also was significantly reduced. In conclusion, the rMS strain expressing the HBHA and human IL-12 fusion protein enhanced immunogencity by improving the Th1-type response against TB, and the protective effect was equivalent to that of the conventional BCG vaccine in mice. Furthermore, it could decrease bacterial load and alleviate histopathological damage in lungs of M. tuberculosis infected mice." ;

The results demonstrated that 1 exhibits an inhibitory effect on LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. The anti-inflammatory action shown by 1 suppressed LPS-induced NF-κB activation, resulting in the down-regulation of iNOS and COX-2 protein expression, attributable to the inhibitory action of LPS-induced NO and PGE(2) production. Compound 1 inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation and the degradation of inhibitory kappa B (IκBα) and decreased the nuclear translocation of p50 and p65. In addition, 1 exhibited an inhibitory effect on LPS-induced NF-κB-DNA and AP-1-DNA binding activity, using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay with NF-κB- and AP-1-specific (32)P-labeled probes. The LPS-induced mitogen-activated protein kinases (p-JNK, p-p38, and p-ERK) and p-Akt were inhibited after 30 and 10 min of LPS stimulation, respectively. In addition, TNF-α production was suppressed by 1." ;

The database uses a LIMS system based on the structure of Base2.9. The database currently contains 240 microarray experiments  annotated accordingly to MIAME standards and thoroughly analyzed in order to pass severe quality control tests. A meeting will be organized for defining policies on data sharing within the DC-THERA community and beyond. 

In order to populate DC-BASE with data obtained from the literature, we used the GEO Import Perl program to download the required experiments from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and to convert them into a spreadsheet based format called MAGE-TAB. MAGE-TAB data has then been imported into DC-BASE.

We have collaborated with the team lead by Andrea Splendiani for the definition of shared terminologies for the annotation of the microarray datasets. These terminologies are at the basis of semantic interoperability with other resources, and the DC-THERA Directory in particular. More specifically, a query to to the Directory will propagate to the DC-ATLAS microarray repository. The DC-THERA Directory will then present a summary of results found.

Access to DC-BASE is provided through the DC-THERA Directory.""" ;

We investigated whether earlier stages of liver fibrosis prior to cirrhosis were associated with discordance between CD4 count (CD4N) and CD4 percentage (CD4%) in HIV-infected patients.MethodsIn cross-sectional analysis of 287 HIV-infected participants of the AIDS Linked to the Intravenous Experience (ALIVE) cohort, we evaluated CD4N, CD4% and transient elastography staging of liver fibrosis. High CD4+ lymphocyte discordance was defined as higher CD4% relative to the CD4N based on accepted clinical cutoffs; multivariable logistic regression was used to determine covariates associated with discordance.ResultsOf 287 participants, 99 (34.4%) had high CD4+ discordance, which increased to 76% of 114 participants with marked lymphopenia (total lymphocyte count [TLC] ≤1200 cells/mm(3)). In multivariable analysis, the odds of having high CD4+ discordance was increased in persons with significant liver fibrosis compared to those without fibrosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.69, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-2.96); the odds of discordance increased to 2.66 (95% CI, 1.11-6.40) among the subset of participants with TLC ≤1200. The odds for discordance associated with cirrhosis were of similar magnitude as observed with significant fibrosis.ConclusionsIn HIV-infected persons, liver fibrosis is associated with discordant peripheral CD4+ lymphocyte results, especially in the setting of marked lymphopenia. Clinicians should also consider CD4% when interpreting absolute CD4+ counts of HIV-infected persons with known or suspected liver disease, particularly if TLC<1200 cells/mm(3)." ;

We evaluated factors associated with, absolute CD4 count and CD4% discordance in a cohort of HIV/HCV+ patients.MethodsBaseline data were analyzed from 908 participants in a prospective Canadian, multi-site cohort of HIV-HCV co-infected individuals. Absolute CD4 cell count and CD4% relationships were evaluated. We defined low/high and very low/high discordant absolute CD4 count/CD4% relationships as CD4% values that were 7% and 14% lower or greater than the expected value for the observed absolute CD4 count. Factors associated with high or very high discordance were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression models including either end-stage liver disease or APRI score >1.5, and compared to groups with concordant and low discordant results.ResultsHigh/very high discordance was seen in 31% (n=286) while 35% (n=321) had concordant values. Factors associated with very high discordance at baseline included history of end stage liver disease (aOR 6.52; 95% CI, 2.27 - 18.67) and APRI score >1.5 (aOR 4.69; 95% CI, 1.64 - 13.35).

      dc:description "Choroidal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignant tumour in adults. The aim of the study was to examine epidemiological characteristics of choroidal melanoma in Split-Dalmatia County from 1990 to 2009. In this retrospective study, data on 46 patients from medical documentation of the University Department of Ophthalmology, Split University Hospital Center, were analyzed. According to 2001 census, the Split-Dalmatia County population was 467,676 inhabitants. The incidence of choroidal melanoma was 0.49 per 100,000 inhabitants, which is somewhere in the middle of the incidence between south and north Europe. Choroidal melanoma most commonly appeared in the 7th decade of life. The average dimensions of choroidal melanoma (basis x height) were 13.4 x 8.0 mm. Histopathologic findings according to Callender classification showed the following types of melanoma: epithelioid cell type 8%, spindle cell type 40%, and mixed type 52%. The most common forms of therapy were enucleation 47.8% and brachytherapy 28.3%, which means that patients presented relatively late when choroidal melanoma advanced in size. The Split-Dalmatia County has 1/10 of the Croatian population, so it could be supposed that approximately 25 new cases of malignant melanoma of the choroid are discovered annually in Croatia. For early detection of the disease, regular and complete checkups are necessary, especially in presbyopic population. Study results enabled better evaluation of the disease and better planning of ophthalmologic service in the treatment of this serious eye disease." ;

Allergen specific immunotherapy (IT) has been widely used for many years as a specific treatment of allergic diseases. This study aimed to investigate the changes in clinical and immunological markers before and after Phoenix dactylifera IT in AR patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total symptom score and levels of total immunoglobulin E (IgE), albumin, interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-4, and IL-13 were measured in the serum and nasal samples of thirty non-atopic healthy controls and thirty patients with allergic rhinitis before and after 15 months of IT. RESULTS: We found significantly higher concentrations of serum TNF-α and nasal TNF-α and IL-13, and significantly lower concentration of nasal IL-10, in allergic patients than in non-allergic. Moreover, serum and nasal IL-10 increased significantly after IT. However, there was neither a significant reduction in total IgE nor a significant increase in IFN-γ at the end of IT. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a clinical improvement associated with a decline in some inflammation parameters after IT. Moreover, date palm IT induced a significant increase in serum and nasal IL-10 levels." ;

      dc:description "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether three specific interleukin-10 (IL-10) polymorphisms confer susceptibility to psoriasis. METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted on the associations between the IL-10-1082 G/A, -592 C/A polymorphisms and haplotypes of the IL-10-1082 G/A, -592 C/A, -819 C/T polymorphisms and psoriasis. RESULTS: A total of eight studies involving 1,018 psoriasis patients and 1,186 controls were considered in the meta-analysis. No association was found between psoriasis and the IL-10-1082 G allele in all study subjects [odds ratio (OR) = 1.098, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.923-1.306, p = 0.291] or between this allele and psoriasis in Europeans (OR = 0.990, 95 % CI = 0.809-1.214, p = 0.925), but a significant association was found in Asians (OR = 1.785, 95 % CI = 1.144-2.76, p = 0.011). Three polymorphisms at the promoter region of IL-10 (-1082 G/A, -819 C/T, -592 C/A) are known to be in complete linkage disequilibrium, but no association was found between the haplotype and psoriasis. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows that the IL-10-1082 G/A polymorphism confers susceptibility to psoriasis in Asians, and suggests that the IL-10 promoter -1082 polymorphism has an ethnicity-specific effect." ;

      dc:description "We investigated the mechanism of indole-3-carbinol (13C)/ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced apoptosis using SK-MEL-2 and SK-MEL-5 human melanoma cells. 13C/UVB significantly reduced the viability of SK-MEL-2 cells, whereas it had little influence on SK-MEL-5 cells. Correspondingly, cell cycle analysis showed that 13C/UVB induced a clear increase in the sub-G0/G1 phase in SK-MEL-2 cells. Furthermore, 13C/UVB activated caspase-9, caspase-8, caspase-3, and Bid and caused the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in SK-MEL-2 cells. In contrast, 13C/UVB showed no effects on the apoptotic signaling pathways in SK-MEL-5 cells. Moreover, we found that 13C down-regulated the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) in SK-MEL-2 cells, but not in SK-MEL-5 cells. Next, to investigate the involvement of MITF in 13C/UVB-induced apoptosis, MITF silencing was conducted using small interfering RNA (siRNA) for MITF in SK-MEL-5 cells. Interestingly, 13C/UVB dramatically decreased the viability of MITF-down-regulated SK-MEL-5 cells. These results indicate that MITF plays a critical role in melanoma cell survival." ;

The aim of the present study was to describe the age-related effects and the impact of in vivo dietary carotenoid depletion and repletion on specific and non-specific immunity. A total of ninety-eight healthy male subjects (aged 20-75 years) received a carotenoid-depleted diet for 3 weeks and were then supplemented daily for 5 weeks with 30 mg β-carotene, 15 mg lycopene and 9 mg lutein. Blood samples were collected at study entry, after depletion and supplementation, and biomarkers of immune status were determined. We found that serum IgA levels were positively correlated with ageing. Lymphocyte phenotyping indicated an increase with age in the memory T-helper cell subpopulation (CD4+CD45RO+) concomitantly with a decrease in naive T-helper cells (CD4+CD45RA+). A significant increase in the natural killer cells subpopulation and a small decrease in B lymphocytes were also observed, especially for the oldest volunteers. From ex vivo cell function exploration, a positive correlation was observed between age and IL-2 production of phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes. Neutrophils' bactericidal activity was significantly impaired with age (from 50 years) and was modulated by carotenoid status. An age effect was found on neutrophils' spontaneous migration but not on directed migration. Immune response in healthy human subjects is mostly affected by age rather than by dietary carotenoid depletion and repletion. Even in carefully selected healthy volunteers, some age-related immune changes occur predominantly from 50 years onwards. This immunosenescence could generate a loss in the immune system adjustment capacity." ;

      dc:description "BACKGROUND: Lipid emulsions have been suggested to reduce immune responses, particularly in severely stressed patients. The authors investigated the influence of the slow intravenous infusion of a soybean oil-based lipid emulsion on some immune parameters in patients who had undergone an esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. METHODS: Thirty-two patients who had undergone an esophagectomy were randomly divided into a lipid emulsion (LPD)-treated group and a control group. All patients received parenteral feeding with a glucose-based solution. Patients in the LPD group received 100 mL of a 20% soybean oil emulsion for 7 days after the esophagectomy in addition to the glucose-based feeding. A slow infusion rate (0.09-0.12 g/kg/h) was adopted to take account of the intrinsic degradation of infused lipids. Immune responses were measured based on lymphocyte proliferation and serum concentrations of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The authors also measured levels of rapid turnover proteins (ie, transferrin, prealbumin, and retinol-binding protein). RESULTS: Phytohemagglutinin- and concanavalin A-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation significantly decreased after the esophagectomy, but no significant difference was seen between the LPD and control groups. No significant difference in changes in plasma concentrations of MCP-1, IL-6 and TNF-α occurred between the 2 groups either. Plasma concentrations of rapid turnover proteins did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the lipid emulsion did not affect the immune parameters measured in patients who had undergone an esophagectomy when administered at a slow rate.

      dc:description "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: T lymphocytes are orchestrators of adaptive immunity. Naive T cells may differentiate into Th1, Th2, Th17 or iTreg phenotypes, depending on environmental co-stimulatory signals. To identify genes and pathways involved in differentiation of Jurkat T cells towards Th1 and Th2 subtypes we performed comprehensive transcriptome analyses of Jurkat T cells stimulated with various stimuli and pathway inhibitors. Results from these experiments were validated in a human experimental setting using whole blood and purified CD4+ Tcells. RESULTS: Calcium-dependent activation of T cells using CD3/CD28 and PMA/CD3 stimulation induced a Th1 expression profile reflected by increased expression of T-bet, RUNX3, IL-2, and IFNgamma, whereas calcium-independent activation via PMA/CD28 induced a Th2 expression profile which included GATA3, RXRA, CCL1 and Itk. Knock down with siRNA and gene expression profiling in the presence of selective kinase inhibitors showed that proximal kinases Lck and PKCtheta are crucial signaling hubs during T helper cell activation, revealing a clear role for Lck in Th1 development and for PKCtheta in both Th1 and Th2 development. Medial signaling via MAPkinases appeared to be less important in these pathways, since specific inhibitors of these kinases displayed a minor effect on gene expression. Translation towards a primary, whole blood setting and purified human CD4+ T cells revealed that PMA/CD3 stimulation induced a more pronounced Th1 specific, Lck and PKCtheta dependent IFNgamma production, whereas PMA/CD28 induced Th2 specific IL-5 and IL-13 production, independent of Lck activation. PMA/CD3-mediated skewing towards a Th1 phenotype was also reflected in mRNA expression of the master transcription factor Tbet, whereas PMA/CD28-mediated stimulation enhanced GATA3 mRNA expression in primary human CD4+ Tcells. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies stimulatory pathways and gene expression profiles for in vitro skewing of T helper cell activation. PMA/CD3 stimulation enhances a Th1-like response in an Lck and PKCtheta dependent fashion, whereas PMA/CD28 stimulation results in a Th2-like phenotype independent of the proximal TCR-tyrosine kinase Lck. This approach offers a robust and fast translational in vitro system for skewed T helper cell responses in Jurkat T cells, primary human CD4+ Tcells and in a more complex matrix such as human whole blood." ;

However, the combined effect of geldanamycin and parthenolide on epithelial ovarian cancer cells has not been studied. In the respect of cell death process, we investigated the promoting effect of parthenolide on geldanamycin-induced apoptosis in the human epithelial ovarian carcinoma cell lines OVCAR-3 and SK-OV-3. Geldanamycin induced a decrease in Bid, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and survivin protein levels; an increase in Bax and tumour suppressor p53 levels; loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential; cytochrome c release; activation of caspases (-8, -9 and -3); cleavage of PARP-1; and increase in the reactive oxygen species formation. Parthenolide enhanced geldanamycin-induced changes in the apoptosis-related protein levels, reactive oxygen species formation, nuclear damage and cell death. The combined effect was inhibited by the addition of oxidant scavengers. The results suggest that parthenolide may potentiate the apoptotic effect of geldanamycin on ovarian carcinoma cell lines by the activation of the caspase-8- and Bid-dependent pathway and the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. The apoptosis promoting effect seems to be mediated by the stimulatory effect on the formation of reactive oxygen species." ;

      dc:description "Members of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) family are key regulators of various human and mammalian signaling pathways, but data on their occurrence and functions in ancient vertebrates are limited. This study characterizes for the first time to our knowledge a PIAS4 homologue (PIAS4a) from zebrafish. Structurally, this zebrafish PIAS4a (zfPIAS4a) shares a number of conserved functional domains with mammalian PIAS4 proteins, including the scaffold attachment factor A/B/acinus/PIAS box, PINIT, and RING-finger-like zinc-binding domains and a highly acidic domain in the C-terminal region. Subcellular localization analysis shows that zfPIAS4a is a nuclear-localized protein and that the C terminus of the molecule harbors strict nuclear localization signals. Functionally, zfPIAS4a expression can be dramatically induced by the stimulation of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid and zebrafish IFN1. It acts as a critical negative regulator of the TIR domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-β, mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS), and IFN signaling pathways, and it is the first PIAS protein that plays a role in the MAVS-mediated pathway to be identified. The structure and functionality of PIAS4 seem highly conserved from zebrafish to mammals, making zebrafish an attractive model for screens designed to uncover genes involved in IFN- and inflammatory cytokine-induced signaling pathways. This study provides preliminary evidence that the PIAS regulatory mechanism already existed in fish during vertebrate evolution. It presents valuable clues for improving the understanding of not only the negative regulation of cytokine signaling in fish but also the evolutionary history of the PIAS family from fish to mammals as a whole." ;

      dc:description "Our interest focused on an open question whether AT-(1-7), nonpeptide receptor agonist: AVE 0991, is able to ameliorate atherosclerosis. We used an apolipoprotein E (apoE) - knockout mice model of atherosclerosis. Experimental groups received the same diet as control, mixed with: AVE 0991 at a dose of 0.58 μmol/kg b.w./day, perindopril at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg b.w./day or with tiorphan at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg b.w./day. A-779 [(D-alanine)-angiotensin (1-7)] was given at a dose of 3.3 mg/kg b.w., 3 times a week i.p. Measured by \"en face\" method, the percentage of occupied by Sudan IV-stained surfaces were as follows: 14.2±1.9 % in control group, whereas in AVE 0991-treated as well as in perindopril-treated groups percentages were statistically significantly lower. In tiorphan group there was no change comparing to control group, whereas in A-779 group percentage was statistically significantly higher. \"Cross-section\" of aortic roots revealed also the difference in atherosclerotic lesions. The mean surfaces, occupied by oil red O-stained changes were: 91.213±8.123 μm(2) in control group, while in AVE 0991-treated as well as in perindopril-treated groups lesions were statistically significantly lower. In tiorphan group there was no change; however, in A-779 group lesions were statistically significantly higher. Measured by real time RT-PCR relative p22phox (submit of NADPH oxidase) expression was significantly decreased in AVE 0991-treated mice. As revealed by flow cytometry, the expression of co-stimulatory molecules: CD86, CD80 and CD40 on both dendritic cells (CD11c+) and macrophages (F4/80+) was reduced in AVE 0991-treated group, which correlated with decreased expression of CD69 activation marker on CD4+T cells. In our report we showed the beneficial effect of AVE 0991 on atherogenesis in gene-targeted mice." ;

Our aim was to examine the beneficial effects of ulinastatin on pulmonary damage associated with scald injury. Lewis rats were subjected to 30% total body surface area (TBSA) scald injury and were randomly divided into a burn control (S group) and an ulinastatin-treated group (U group). Lung malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were determined, and the lungs were examined histologically with immunohistochemistry (IHC) as well for the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I chain-related antigen A (MICA) and Bcl-2 at 24, 48 and 72h after the injury. The expression of spleen human leucocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) was detected by immunohistochemistry analysis. Selectins and adhesion molecules in lungs and serum were also detected. The lung injury degree was represented as wet/dry (W/D) values and alveolar thickness. Ulinastatin decreased MDA levels and ameliorated the down-regulation of SOD activity. MICA was up-regulated after the scald, and this up-regulation was greatly diminished by ulinastatin. Bcl-2 was up-regulated after the scald, especially in the U group. The spleen HLA-DR expression demonstrated the immunoregulatory effects of ulinastatin, which effectively protected the pulmonary tissues from scald-induced injury. Our results demonstrated that pulmonary damage was associated with autoimmunity and oxidant attack after severe scald. Ulinastatin exhibits significant protective effects on these effects." ;

      dc:description "Co-infections alter the host immune response but how the systemic and local processes at the site of infection interact is still unclear. The majority of studies on co-infections concentrate on one of the infecting species, an immune function or group of cells and often focus on the initial phase of the infection. Here, we used a combination of experiments and mathematical modelling to investigate the network of immune responses against single and co-infections with the respiratory bacterium Bordetella bronchiseptica and the gastrointestinal helminth Trichostrongylus retortaeformis. Our goal was to identify representative mediators and functions that could capture the essence of the host immune response as a whole, and to assess how their relative contribution dynamically changed over time and between single and co-infected individuals. Network-based discrete dynamic models of single infections were built using current knowledge of bacterial and helminth immunology; the two single infection models were combined into a co-infection model that was then verified by our empirical findings. Simulations showed that a T helper cell mediated antibody and neutrophil response led to phagocytosis and clearance of B. bronchiseptica from the lungs. This was consistent in single and co-infection with no significant delay induced by the helminth. In contrast, T. retortaeformis intensity decreased faster when co-infected with the bacterium. Simulations suggested that the robust recruitment of neutrophils in the co-infection, added to the activation of IgG and eosinophil driven reduction of larvae, which also played an important role in single infection, contributed to this fast clearance. Perturbation analysis of the models, through the knockout of individual nodes (immune cells), identified the cells critical to parasite persistence and clearance both in single and co-infections. Our integrated approach captured the within-host immuno-dynamics of bacteria-helminth infection and identified key components that can be crucial for explaining individual variability between single and co-infections in natural populations." ;

A picture is emerging in which mucosal epithelial cells instruct dendritic cells to promote Th2 responses in the absence of IL-12 (interleukin 12) production and provide instruction through thymic stromal lymphopoieitin (TSLP) or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). At the same time, allergens, helminths and chemical adjuvants elicit the response of innate immune cells like basophils, which provide more polarizing cytokines and IL-4 and reinforce Th2 immunity. This unique communication between cells will only be fully appreciated if we study Th2 immunity in vivo and in a tissue-specific context, and can only be fully understood if we compare several models of Th2 immune response induction." ;

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) on the pial microcirculation in experimental endotoxemia using intravital microscopy. Our hypothesis is rhAPC protects pial microcirculation in endotoxemia. METHODS: Endotoxemia was generated in Lewis rats with intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 5mg/kg i.v.). Dura mater was removed through a cranial window to expose pial vessels on the brain surface. The microcirculation, including leukocyte-endothelial interaction, functional capillary density (FCD) and plasma extravasation of pial vessels was examined by fluorescent intravital microscopy (IVM) 2h after administration of LPS, LPS and rhAPC or equivalent amount of saline (used as Control group). Plasma cytokine levels of interleukin 1 alpha (IL1-α), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon γ (IFN-γ), Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were evaluated after IVM. RESULTS: LPS challenge significantly increased leukocyte adhesion (773±190 vs. 592±152n/mm(2) Control), decreased FCD (218±54 vs. 418±74cm/cm(2) Control) and increased proinflammatory cytokine levels (IL-1α: 5032±1502 vs. 8±21pg/ml; TNF-α: 1823±1007 vs. 168±228pg/ml; IFN-γ: 785±434 vs. 0pg/ml; GM-CSF: 54±52 vs. 1±3pg/ml) compared to control animals. rhAPC treatment significantly reduced leukocyte adhesion (599±111n/mm(2)), increased FCD (516±118cm/cm(2)) and reduced IL-1α levels (2134±937pg/ml) in the endotoxemic rats. CONCLUSION: APC treatment significantly improves pial microcirculation by reducing leukocyte adhesion and increasing FCD." ;

      dc:description "The present study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of ginseng total saponins (GTSs) and its underlying mechanisms in a rat model of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Rats were injected with GTSs (20 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle for 14 days after TBI. Neurological functions were determined using beam balance and prehensile traction tests at 1-14 days after trauma. Brain samples were extracted at 1 day after trauma for determination of water content, Nissl staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotin-dUTP nick end labeling, and measurement of oxidative stress variables and inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, the dose response of the neuroprotective effect and time window of the efficacy of GTSs were also determined. We found that treatment of GTSs 1) improved the neurological function with an effective dosage of 5-80 mg/kg and an efficacy time window of 3-6 hr after TBI; 2) reduced brain water content and neuronal loss in the hippocampal CA3 area; 3) increased the activity of superoxide dismutase and decreased the activity of nitric oxide synthase and the amount of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide; 4) down-regulated interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α and upregulated interleukin-10 in the cortical area surrounding the injured core; and 5) inhibited the apoptotic cell death and expression of caspase-3 and bax and raised the expression of bcl-2. These findings suggest that administration of GTSs after TBI could reduce the secondary injury through inhibiting oxidative and nitrative stress, attenuating inflammatory response, and reducing apoptotic cell death. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc." ;

      dc:description "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a longevity-associated protein, which regulates energy metabolism and lifespan in response to nutrient deprivation. It has been proposed to be a therapeutic target for obesity and metabolic syndrome. We investigated whether α-lipoic acid (ALA) exerts a lipid-lowering effect through regulation of SIRT1 activation and production in C(2)C(12) myotubes. METHODS: ALA-stimulated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), adipose triacylglycerol lipase (ATGL) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) production, as well as intracellular triacylglycerol accumulation and fatty acid β-oxidation were analysed in the absence or presence of a SIRT1 inhibitor (nicotinamide), SIRT1 small interfering (si) RNA and an AMPK inhibitor (compound C) in C(2)C(12) myotubes. Mice with streptozotocin/nicotinamide-induced diabetes and db/db mice fed on a high-fat diet were used to study the ALA-mediated lipid-lowering effects in vivo. RESULTS: ALA increased the NAD(+)/NADH ratio to enhance SIRT1 activity and production in C(2)C(12) myotubes. ALA subsequently increased AMPK and ACC phosphorylation, leading to increased palmitate β-oxidation and decreased intracellular triacylglycerol accumulation in C(2)C(12) myotubes. In cells treated with nicotinamide or transfected with SIRT1 siRNA, ALA-mediated AMPK/ACC phosphorylation, intracellular triacylglycerol accumulation and palmitate β-oxidation were reduced, suggesting that SIRT1 is an upstream regulator of AMPK. ALA increased ATGL and suppressed FAS protein production in C(2)C(12) myotubes. Oral administration of ALA in diabetic mice fed on a high-fat diet and db/db mice dramatically reduced the body weight and visceral fat content. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: ALA activates both SIRT1 and AMPK, which leads to lipid-lowering effects in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that ALA may have beneficial effects in the treatment of dyslipidaemia and obesity." ;

(CIL) is widely used as an anti-inflammatory agent in Asia and our preliminary study revealed that CIL reduced interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 in 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB)-treated HaCaT cells, a human keratinocyte cell line. We investigated the atopic dermatitis (AD) effect of topically applied CIL in mice with AD-like symptoms. After topical application of 1,3-butylen glycol (control), CIL-Low (5%), CIL-High (30%), or 0.1% hydrocortisone (HC) on the AD-like skin lesions in DNCB-treated NC/Nga mice for 5 weeks, the ear thickness, mast cell infiltration, and serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), IgG1, IL-4 and interferon (IFN)-γ were measured. The gene expressions of IL-4, IL-13, and IFN-γ in the dorsal skin were assayed. CIL treatment dosedependently reduced severity of clinical symptoms of dorsal skin, ear thickness, and the number of mast cells and eosinophils. CIL-High significantly decreased serum IgE, IgG1, IL-4, and IFN-γ levels and reduced mRNA levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-13 in dorsal skin lesion. The improvement by CIL-High was similar to HC, but without its adverse effects such as skin atrophy maceration, and secondary infection. In conclusion, CIL may be an effective alternative substance for the management of AD." ;

      dc:description "Microarrays of RNA aptamers are fabricated in a one-step, multiplexed enzymatic synthesis on gold thin films in a microfluidic format and then employed in the detection of protein biomarkers with surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRI) measurements. Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) oligonucleotides are transcribed on-chip from double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) templates attached to microarray elements (denoted as generator elements) by the surface transcription reaction of T7 RNA polymerase. As they are synthesized, the ssRNA oligonucleotides diffuse in the microfluidic channel and are quickly captured by hybridization adsorption onto adjacent single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) microarray elements (denoted as detector elements) that contain a sequence complementary to 5'-end of the ssRNA. The RNA aptamers attached to these detector elements are subsequently used in SPRI measurements for the bioaffinity detection of protein biomarkers. The microfluidic generator-detector element format permits the simultaneous fabrication of multiple ssRNA oligonucleotides with different capture sequences that can hybridize simultaneously to distinct detector elements and thus create a multiplexed aptamer microarray. In an initial set of demonstration experiments, SPRI measurements are used to monitor the bioaffinity adsorption of human thrombin (hTh) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) proteins onto RNA aptamer microarrays fabricated in situ with this on-chip RNA polymerase synthesis methodology. Additional SPRI measurements of the hydrolysis and desorption of the surface-bound ssRNA aptamers with a surface RNase H are used to verify the capture of ssRNA with RNA-DNA surface hybridization onto the detector elements. The on-chip RNA synthesis described here is an elegant, one-step multiplexed methodology for the rapid and contamination-free fabrication of RNA aptamer microarrays for protein biosensing with SPRI." ;

      rdfs:comment """At the end of 2004 BruCells has initiated two identical clinical studies entitled: “A Phase IB/II Study of Immunotherapy with Autologous Dendritic Cells Pulsed with Multiple HLA-A2 and MAGE-3.DP4 Peptides in Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma Patients”. Patients received sequential immunizations with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with 8 HLA-restricted HLA-A2 peptides and a MAGE-3.DP4 peptide. They were randomized to receive immunizations either with I3 DC (DC generated with interferon-beta and interleukin-3) or with G4 DC (DC generated with GM-CSF and IL-4). At the end of 2005 the study was prematurely terminated due to low recruitment, data on patient responses is available.

2 patients received vaccines up to cycle 3. One of them is an I3 patient (E501) who has received 9 vaccines with peptides only. The other one is a G4 patient (E507) who has received 6 vaccines with peptide only. Both patients received a sequence of six immunizations every two weeks, consisting of autologous dendritic cells loaded with the 8 HLA-A2 restricted peptides and MAGE.3-DP4 in Cycle 1. In Cycle 2, they received a sequence of three immunizations every six weeks, consisting of autologous dendritic cells loaded with the 8 HLA-A2 restricted peptides and MAGE.3-DP4. Initially, in Cycle 3, immunizations have been continued with peptide-only injections of all 9 peptides except Tyrosinase at 12 weeks intervals. For the continuation of the vaccinations the clinicians have decided to inject the patients at 6 months intervals. Both patients who clinically showed Partial Response at the end of cycle 1 are currently doing well under this treatment, but at the beginning of 2008 the vaccination program has been ended.
Both patients had clinically shown Partial Response at the end of cycle 1 and were in complete remission in the course of cycle 3.

For the analysis of the immune responses, specific CTL directed against the 8 antigens was assessed by using restimulation in vitro, followed by staining with the corresponding tetramer and cloning of the tetramer-positive lymphocytes. The result of these tests were considered positive if the post-immunization frequency of the different anti-TAA CTLp among the CD8+ T cells was 10-fold higher than the one encountered before vaccination.
For both patients the tests were performed on frozen peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) obtained from leukapheresis or buffy-coat collections performed before and after the 6 vaccinations in Cycle 1 and after the 3 vaccinations of Cycle 2.

The fresh PBL samples were collected from UTCM (Hôpital Erasme, ULB) and were transferred to Ludwig Institute where the freezing of the samples and analyses were performed.

Frequencies of precursors of CD8 T cells stained by a tetramer containing the specific peptide had shown for patient E501 post-vaccination frequencies of the T cells of anti-NY-ESO-1.A2 and anti-Tyrosinase.A2 that were >=10-fold higher than that of pre-vaccinations, indicating a specific CTL response to these vaccinations.

An analysis performed on PBL collected after the 3 vaccinations of cycle 2 clearly shows that the frequencies for both anti-NY-ESO-1.A2 and anti-Tyrosinase.A2 T cells are still elevated.

For E507 no immunological response to the vaccinations had been observed after cycle 1 and a new analysis on PBL collected after cycle 2 did not show any change.""" ;

Schwannian differentiation was inferred from the presence of areas with nuclear palisading resembling Verocay bodies, from plexiform architecture and from the presence of a thin rim of EMA positivity around the tumor. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization showed genomic losses that overlap with those seen in sporadic schwanomma.

We wanted to determine the role of paeonol in treating adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We established an acute lung injury (ALI) model in Sprague-Dawley rats, which was similar to ARDS in humans, using intratracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The intraperitoneal administration of paeonol successfully reduced histopathological scores and attenuated myeloperoxidase-reactive cells as an index of polymorphonuclear neutrophils infiltration and also reduces inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in the lung tissue, at 16 h after LPS administration. In addition, paeonol reduced proinflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, including tumor-necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and plasminogen-activated inhibition factor-1. These results indicated that paeonol successfully attenuates inflammatory and coagulation reactions to protect against ALI." ;

      dc:description "The ERK1/2 signaling pathway regulates a variety of T-cell functions. We observed dynamic changes in the expression of ERK1/2 during T-helper cell differentiation. Specifically, the expression of ERK1/2 was decreased and increased by IL-12 and IL-4, respectively. To address this subject further, we examined the specific role of ERK1 in Th2 differentiation and development of experimental asthma using ERK1(-/-) mice. ERK1(-/-) mice were unable to mount airway inflammation and hyperreactivity in two different models of asthma, acute and chronic. ERK1(-/-) mice had reduced expression of Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 but not IL-17A or IFN-γ. They had reduced levels of allergen-specific IgE and blood eosinophils. T cells from immunized ERK1(-/-) mice manifested reduced proliferation in response to the sensitizing allergen. ERK1(-/-) T cells had reduced and short-lived expression of JunB following TCR stimulation, which likely contributed to their impaired Th2 differentiation. Immunized ERK1(-/-) mice showed reduced numbers of CD44(high) CD4 T cells in the spleen. In vitro studies demonstrated that Th2 but not Th1 cells from ERK1(-/-) mice had reduced numbers of CD44(high) cells. Finally, CD4 T cells form ERK1(-/-) mice expressed higher levels of BIM under growth factor-deprived conditions and reduced Mcl-1 on stimulation. As a result, the survival of CD4 T cells, especially CD44(high) Th2 cells, was much reduced in ERK1(-/-) mice. We conclude that ERK1 plays a nonredundant role in Th2 differentiation and development of experimental asthma. ERK1 controls Th2 differentiation and survival through its effect on JunB and BIM, respectively.-Goplen, N., Karim, Z., Guo, L., Zhuang, Y., Huang, H., Gorska, M.

Jointly, P2 and P6 identified a large number of stored samples of DC from melanoma patients (who had been treated in clinical trials of DC-based therapy at the two respective centres) that would be suitable for subsequent analysis. However, it further became clear that there were differences in the techniques that had been used to freeze the samples at different period. This necessitated a pilot experiment to compare and assess the suitability (e.g. RNA stability) of different samples frozen in different ways. First results are available. These revealed that all stored samples could be analysed in detail, and it was further decided to process the samples such that analysis of micro-RNA expression could be undertaken at a later stage. Patient samples have been shipped from the two centres to the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics and the main ‘reference experiment’ commenced at the beginning of 2009.""" ;

To establish its importance, we treated susceptible rats with a depleting anti-rat Vβ13 monoclonal antibody and then exposed them to either polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid or a diabetogenic virus to induce diabetes. The overall frequency of diabetes in the controls was 74% (n = 50), compared with 17% (n = 30) in the anti-Vβ13-treated animals, with minimal islet pathology in nondiabetic treated animals. T cells isolated from islets on day 5 after starting induction showed a greater proportion of Vβ13(+) T cells than did peripheral lymph node T cells. Vβ13 transcripts recovered from day 5 islets revealed focused Jβ usage and less CDR3 diversity than did transcripts from peripheral Vβ13(+) T cells. CDR3 usage was not skewed in control Vβ16 CDR3 transcripts. Anti-rat Vβ13 antibody also prevented spontaneous diabetes in BBDP rats. The Iddm14 gene is likely to be Tcrb-V13, indicating that TCR β-chain usage is a determinant of susceptibility to autoimmune diabetes in rats. It may be possible to prevent autoimmune diabetes by targeting a limited element of the T-cell repertoire." ;

We investigated changes in cytokine expression in injured peripheral nerves and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) following electroacupuncture (EA) treatment. Neuropathic pain was induced by peripheral nerve injury to the left hind limb of Sprague-Dawley rats under pentobarbital anesthesia. Two weeks later, the nerve-injured rats were treated by EA for 10 minutes. The expression levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in peripheral nerves and DRG of neuropathic rats were significantly increased in nerve-injured rats. However, after EA, the cytokine expression levels were noticeably decreased in peripheral nerves and DRG. These results suggest that EA stimulation can reduce the levels of proinflamtory cytokines elevated after nerve injury." ;

SETTING:: Academic large-animal and computational laboratories. SUBJECTS:: Outbred juvenile swine. INTERVENTIONS:: Four swine were instrumented and subjected to endotoxemia (100 µg/kg), followed by serial plasma sampling. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: Swine exhibited various degrees of inflammation and acute lung injury, including one death with severe acute lung injury (PaO2/FIO2 ratio μ200 and static compliance μ10 L/cm H2O). Plasma interleukin-1β, interleukin-4, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor-α, high mobility group box-1, and NO2/NO3 were significantly (p μ .05) elevated over the course of the experiment. Principal component analysis was used to suggest principal drivers of inflammation. Based in part on principal component analysis, an ordinary differential equation model was constructed, consisting of the lung and the blood (as a surrogate for the rest of the body), in which endotoxin induces tumor necrosis factor-α in monocytes in the blood, followed by the trafficking of these cells into the lung leading to the release of high mobility group box-1, which in turn stimulates the release of interleukin-1β from resident macrophages. The ordinary differential equation model also included blood pressure, PaO2, and FIO2, and a damage variable that summarizes the health of the animal. This ordinary differential equation model could be fit to both inflammatory and physiologic data in the individual swine. The predicted time course of damage could be matched to the oxygen index in three of the four swine. CONCLUSIONS:: The approach described herein may aid in predicting inflammation and physiologic dysfunction in small cohorts of subjects with diverse phenotypes and outcomes." ;

Serum levels of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) were evaluated in 48 treated women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and mild-to-moderate disease severity. The results were compared between the whole SLE group and the control (29 women). The relationships between chemokines, their concentrations, and peripheral blood leukocyte count and between the chemokines and individual leukocyte populations (polymorphonuclear leukocytes-PMNs, lymphocytes-Ls, monocytes-Ms, eosinophils) counts were determined. The relationships between the analyzed chemokines were also determined in the control. SLE subjects had significantly higher MCP-1, SDF-1, IP-10, and lower IL-8 concentrations compared to the control. Moderate, positive correlations between MCP-1/SDF-1, SDF-1/IP-10 and a negative correlation between MCP-1/IL8 were observed in the patient group. Moderate, negative correlations were found between SDF-1/total leukocyte count, SDF-1/absolute number of PMNs as well as between IP-10/total leukocyte count, IP-10/absolute PMNs, Ls, and Ms counts in peripheral blood of SLE group. We suggest that the obtained results and correlations observed between the examined parameters might be used to monitor SLE course and progression. However, further randomized clinical studies should be carried out on in untreated and treated patients with SLE." ;

Although, Foxo1 is known to be important in regulating CD8(+) T cell trafficking and homeostasis, its role in functional differentiation of antigen-stimulated CD8(+) T cells is unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that inactivation of Foxo1 was essential for instructing T-bet transcription factor-mediated effector differentiation of CD8(+) T cells. The Foxo1 inactivation was dependent on mTORC1 kinase, given that blockade of mTORC1 abrogated mTORC2-mediated Akt (Ser473) kinase phosphorylation, resulting in Foxo1-dependent switch from T-bet to Eomesodermin transcription factor activation and increase in memory precursors. Silencing Foxo1 ablated interleukin-12- and rapamycin-enhanced CD8(+) T cell memory responses and restored T-bet-mediated effector functions. These results demonstrate an essential role of Foxo1 in actively repressing effector or terminal differentiation processes to promote memory CD8(+) T cell development and identify the functionally diverse mechanisms utilized by Foxo1 to promote quiescence and longevity." ;

      dc:description "OBJECTIVE: Independent replication of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) findings remains the gold standard for results validation. Our aim was to test the association of the interleukin 10 (IL10) gene and the interleukin 23 receptor (IL23R) - interleukin 12 receptor beta 2 (IL12RB2) locus previously identified as Behçet's disease (BD) risk factors in two GWAS (1,2). METHODS: Six haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL10 and fortytwo in IL23R-IL12RB2 were genotyped in 973 BD patients and 637 controls. Population stratification was assessed using a panel of 86 ancestry informative markers. RESULTS: Subtle evidence of population stratification was found in our dataset. In IL10, rs1518111 was nominally associated with BD before and after adjusting for population stratification (p(unadj) =2.53E-02, OR(T) [95% CI]=1.20[1.02-1.40]; p(adj) =1.43E-02), and rs1554286 demonstrated a trend for association (p(unadj) =6.14E-02; padj=3.21E-02). Six SNPs in IL23R-IL12RB2 were associated with BD after Bonferroni's correction, the most significant of which were rs17375018 (p(unadj) =1.93E-06, OR(G) [95% CI]=1.51[1.27-1.78]), rs7517847 (p(unadj) =1.23E-06, OR(T) [95% CI]=1.48[1.26-1.74]), and rs924080 (p=1.78E-05, OR(T) [95% CI]=1.29[1.20-1.39]). rs7530511, rs6693831, and rs1495965 were also significantly associated in all tests performed. Meta-analyses with data from previous reports strengthen the role of rs1518111, rs17375018, rs7517847, and rs924080 in BD risk, but no epistatic interactions were detected between IL10 and IL23R-IL12RB2. Imputation analysis highlighted the importance of IL23R regulatory regions in BD susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: Our study independently confirmed, extended and refined the association between BD, IL10 and IL23R-IL12RB2. These associations warrant further validation and investigation in BD as they may have novel therapeutic implications (e.g. immunosuppressive therapy targeted at IL23-p19)." ;

Accumulation of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) with the ability to suppress T cells has been observed in serveral types of cancer, including melanoma. Using blood from melanoma patients we are investigating phenotypic markers that can be used to further characterize MDSC, focusing on molecules that are related to their suppressive function. As it is believed that recruitment from the bone marrow by tumor derived factors leads to increased presence of immature myeloid cells in the blood, we are testing substances that could induce maturation and thereby turn immature suppressor cells into mature cells capable of efficient antigen presentation.
So far we have collected blood from >10 melanoma patients and compared the MDSC phenotype and function with healthy donor derived cells. 

We will collect further material to perform detailed studies of phenotype and function of MDSC in melanoma patients. Using some model substances we are testing a group of drugs for its ability to induce MDSC maturation. We are also interested in studying the effect of MDSC on other immune cells.""" ;

      dc:description "There have been significant improvements in the culture of porcine embryos in vitro; however, it is still suboptimal. Improvements in porcine embryo culture would benefit utilisation of porcine embryos for a variety of purposes. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is known to be expressed in the female reproductive tract and the level of its expression is high between conception and implantation. Previous studies show supplementing GM-CSF in embryo culture promotes embryonic development in human and bovine embryos. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of GM-CSF on the culture of porcine embryos derived from somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) and IVF. Different concentrations of recombinant porcine GM-CSF (0, 2, 10ngmL(-1)) were introduced into Porcine Zygote Medium 3 from Day 1 to 6. Frequencies of cleaved embryos and blastocyst formation were recorded and analysed by using ANOVA following arcsin transformation. Total cell number in blastocysts from each group were counted and compared by using the Student's t-test. Differences at P<0.05 were considered significant. A total of 563 SCNT embryos from 6 different donor cell lines on 11 different days were produced for the study. Incubation of SCNT embryos with GM-CSF did not affect the frequency of cleaved embryos. Frequencies of cleaved embryos in control (0ngmL(-1)), 2ngmL(-1) GM-CSF and 10ngmL(-1) GM-CSF were 64.2%, 68.1% and 65.0%, respectively. Interestingly, both concentrations of GM-CSF significantly increased the frequency of blastocyst formation as compared with the control. In 2ngmL(-1) and 10ngmL(-1) of GM-CSF groups, 30.8% and 32.3% of embryos reached blastocyst respectively, whereas only 22.4% of embryos reached blastocyst in the control group. A significant increase in total cell number in blastocysts was observed when GM-CSF was introduced into embryo culture. An average of 28.8±0.9 cells was recorded in the control group, whereas 31.9±1.1 and 31.8±1.1 were observed in 2ngmL(-1) and 10ngmL(-1) of GM-CSF groups, respectively. Similar effects were observed when GM-CSF was introduced to the culture of IVF embryos. For IVF study, 525 embryos were generated on 10 different days and embryos cultured in the presence of GM-CSF tended to show higher blastocyst formation (P=0.1). Frequencies of blastocyst per cleaved in the 3 groups were 55.7% (control), 65.7% (2ngmL(-1) GM-CSF) and 66.7% (10ngmL(-1) GM-CSF). In addition, culture of IVF embryos with GM-CSF significantly increased total cell number in Day 6 blastocysts. Total cell number in blastocysts in 2ngmL(-1) GM-CSF (34.2±0.8) and 10ngmL(-1) GM-CSF (34.4±1.2) were significantly higher compared with control (27.3±1.2). Our results indicate that introducing GM-CSF into embryo culture media can increase the quality of blastocyst stage embryos. An increase in the frequency of blastocyst formation and total cell number in blastocysts suggests that GM-CSF can be used to produce better-quality embryos in vitro. Currently, effects of GM-CSF on implantation of SCNT embryos are under investigation. Further studies would elucidate the specific mechanism of GM-CSF on porcine embryos." ;

      dc:description "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) belongs to the Hepadnaviridae family of enveloped DNA viruses. It was previously shown that HBV can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activate the IRE1-XBP1 pathway of the unfolded protein response (UPR), through the expression of the viral regulatory protein X (HBx). However, it remained obscure whether or not this activation had any functional consequences on the target genes of the UPR pathway. Of these targets, the ER degradation-enhancing, mannosidase-like proteins (EDEMs) are thought to play an important role in relieving the ER stress during UPR, by recognizing terminally misfolded glycoproteins and delivering them to the ER-associated degradation (ERAD). In this study, we investigated the role of EDEMs in the HBV life-cycle. We found that synthesis of EDEMs (EDEM1 and its homologues, EDEM2 and EDEM3) is significantly up-regulated in cells with persistent or transient HBV replication. Co-expression of the wild-type HBV envelope proteins with EDEM1 resulted in their massive degradation, a process reversed by EDEM1 silencing. Surprisingly, the autophagy/lysosomes, rather than the proteasome were involved in disposal of the HBV envelope proteins. Importantly, inhibition of the endogenous EDEM1 expression in HBV replicating cells significantly increased secretion of both, enveloped virus and subviral particles. This is the first report showing that HBV activates the ERAD pathway, which, in turn, reduces the amount of envelope proteins, possibly as a mechanism to control the level of virus particles in infected cells and facilitate the establishment of chronic infections." ;

      rdfs:comment """We are preparing a protocol for a phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced (stage III or IV) melanoma. Patients will receive a DC vaccination regimen followed by 3 adoptive transfers of autologous in vitro expanded T cells. This novel approach combines in vivo priming by the DC vaccine with passive immunotherapy by lymphocyte infusion. 

Patients will undergo surgical removal of a metastatic lesion and leukapheresis at the beginning of the trial to provide sources for tumor antigens as well as monocytes and T cells, which will be isolated from the leukapheresis product by elutriation. Patients will undergo lymphodepletion prior to vaccination and prior to adoptive transfer of autologous T cells. The DC vaccine will consist of monocyte derived DC loaded with tumor lysate generated from the excised lesion. The T cell transfer will consist of T cells expanded by co-culture with tumor lysate loaded DC. 

The primary objective of this trial is to determine toxicity and feasibility of treatment of patients with advanced melanoma with DC vaccine and adoptive transfer. The secondary objective is to generate large numbers of tumor reactive T cells, characterize these T cells and evaluate immunological and clinical responses in treated patients.

Recently we have optimized our T cell expansion protocol by testing different cytokines and evaluating whether T cell expansion can be improved by using antigen loaded DC as stimulators at all times. We find that mixed PBMCs have superior stimulatory capacity and that IL-2 had the best cost-benefit ratio and will therefore not modify the original protocol. The study protocol has been reviewed by the local ethical committee and is now ready to be submitted to Läkemedelsverket, the Swedish regulatory authority for clinical trials.

Upon approval by swedish authorities we plan to include, treat and evaluate 10 patients during a period of one to two years. """ ;

Two nested case-control studies were built from a cohort of 409 patients with leprosy from central Brazil, monitored for T1R and T2R. There was evidence for association between T2R and IL-6 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs2069832 (P = .002), rs2069840 (P = .03), and rs2069845 (P = .04), with information on the entire IL-6 locus, as well as functional IL-6 variant rs1800795 (P = .005).

New prognostic markers for malignant melanoma are urgently needed. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX-2) have been described to correlate with progression of melanoma. Moreover, activating mutations in BRAF/NRAS oncogenes are often detected in melanoma. We have examined the BRAF/NRAS mutation status and expression of COX-2 and iNOS to compare their prognostic value for overall survival in stage III malignant melanoma.   

Real time and immunohistochemistry analysis showed that both iNOS and COX-2 alone significantly predicted OS. The BRAF/NRAS mutation status did not significantly differ between patient groups, although iNOS significantly correlated with BRAF mutation frequency. Furthermore, iNOS and COX-2 were significantly linked to a number of metastatic lymph nodes. However, iNOS maintained its statistical significance together with a number of lymph nodes in the multivariate analysis and predicted OS, whereas COX-2 did.

We will now move on to study iNOS and COX-2 expression in fresh melanoma tumors. Here we aim to determine the exact phenotype of the iNOS and COX-2 expressing cells. We are especially interested to study expression of these enzymes by tumor infiltrating myeloid cells. Expression of iNOS is a known suppressive mechanism employed by myeloid derived suppressor cells. We will study the presence and function of such suppressive myeloid cells within the tumor.""" ;

However, results mainly from a wide set of in vitro gain-of-function experiments are conflicting since these show that BMPs can act either as inhibitors or promoters of neurogenesis. Here, we report a specific and non-redundant role for BMP7 in cortical neurogenesis in vivo using knockout mice. Bmp7 is produced in regions adjacent to the developing cortex; the hem, meninges, and choroid plexus, and can be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. Bmp7 deletion results in reduced cortical thickening, impaired neurogenesis, and loss of radial glia attachment to the meninges. Subsequent in vitro analyses of E14.5 cortical cells revealed that lack of Bmp7 affects neural progenitor cells, evidenced by their reduced proliferation, survival and self-renewal capacity. Addition of BMP7 was able to rescue these proliferation and survival defects. In addition, at the developmental stage E14.5 Bmp7 was also required to maintain Ngn2 expression in the subventricular zone. These data demonstrate a novel role for Bmp7 in the embryonic mouse cortex: Bmp7 nurtures radial glia cells and regulates fundamental properties of neural progenitor cells that subsequently affect Ngn2-dependent neurogenesis." ;

      dc:description "Previously we showed that transgenic mice expressing human HLA-DR3 gene are susceptible to PLP(91-110) induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and can serve as an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). HLA-DR3 mice with EAE showed increased number of CD8 T cells indicating their important role in disease pathogenesis. The role of CD8 T cells in MS, an inflammatory demyelinating disease of CNS, has been enigmatic as it has been assigned both regulatory and pathogenic roles. Therefore, to evaluate the role of CD8 T cells, we generated CD8 deficient HLA-DR3 transgenic mice (DR3.CD8(-/-)). Immunization with PLP(91-110) led to more severe EAE in DR3.CD8(-/-) mice compared to HLA-DR3 mice indicating a regulatory role for CD8 T cells. Interestingly, DR3.CD8(-/-) mice with EAE showed decreased CNS pathology compared to DR3 mice thus suggesting a pathogenic role for CD8 T cells. We show that these two subsets of CD8 T cells can be differentiated based on the surface expression of CD122 (IL-2 Rβ chain). CD8 T cells expressing CD122 (CD8+CD122+) play a regulatory role while CD8+CD122- T cells act as a pathogenic subset. CD122 expressing CD8 T cells are the regulatory subset of CD8 T cells and regulate the encephalitogenic CD4 T cells through direct modulation of antigen presenting cells and/or through the release of immunoregulatory cytokines such as IL-10, IFNγ and TGFβ. We also showed that adoptive transfer of CD8CD122- T cells caused increased spinal cord demyelination indicating that these are pathogenic subset of CD8 T cells. Our study suggests that CD8+ T cells play both regulatory as well as pathogenic role in disease pathogenesis of EAE. A better understanding of these subsets could aid in designing novel therapy for MS patients." ;

We showed that, whereas total Treg percentages were mildly affected by HIV infection, Treg absolute numbers were significantly reduced in all groups studied. We demonstrated that whereas naïve Treg numbers were essentially preserved, effector Treg were consistently affected during HIV infection. Finally we demonstrated that effector but not total or naïve Treg numbers negatively correlated with the magnitude of HIV specific CD8 T cell responses." ;

However, the cellular origin of MV found in cancer patients' sera varies as do their molecular and cellular profiles. To distinguish tumor-derived MV in cancer patients' sera, we used MAGE 3/6(+) present in tumors and MV. Molecular profiles of MAGE 3/6(+) MV were compared in Western blots or by flow cytometry with those of MV secreted by dendritic cells or activated T cells. These profiles were found to be distinct for each cell type. Only tumor-derived MV were MAGE 3/6(+) and were variably enriched in 42-kDa Fas ligand and MHC class I but not class II molecules. Effects of MV on signaling via the TCR and IL-2R and proliferation or apoptosis of activated primary T cells and T cell subsets were also assessed. Functions of activated CD8(+) and CD4(+) T lymphocytes were differentially modulated by tumor-derived MV. These MV inhibited signaling and proliferation of activated CD8(+) but not CD4(+) T cells and induced apoptosis of CD8(+) T cells, including tumor-reactive, tetramer(+)CD8(+) T cells as detected by flow cytometry for caspase activation and annexin V binding or by DNA fragmentation. Tumor-derived but not dendritic cell-derived MV induced the in vitro expansion of CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) T regulatory cells and enhanced their suppressor activity. The data suggest that tumor-derived MV induce immune suppression by promoting T regulatory cell expansion and the demise of antitumor CD8(+) effector T cells, thus contributing to tumor escape." ;

      dc:description "It is unclear whether the ability of the innate immune system to recognize distinct ligands from a single microbial pathogen via multiple pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) triggers common pathways or differentially triggers specific host responses. In the human mycobacterial infection leprosy, we found that activation of monocytes via nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) by its ligand muramyl dipeptide, as compared to activation via heterodimeric Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 1 (TLR2/1) by triacylated lipopeptide, preferentially induced differentiation into dendritic cells (DCs), which was dependent on a previously unknown interleukin-32 (IL-32)-dependent mechanism. Notably, IL-32 was sufficient to induce monocytes to rapidly differentiate into DCs, which were more efficient than granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-derived DCs in presenting antigen to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted CD8(+) T cells. Expression of NOD2 and IL-32 and the frequency of CD1b(+) DCs at the site of leprosy infection correlated with the clinical presentation; they were greater in patients with limited as compared to progressive disease. The addition of recombinant IL-32 restored NOD2-induced DC differentiation in patients with the progressive form of leprosy. In conclusion, the NOD2 ligand-induced, IL-32-dependent DC differentiation pathway contributes a key and specific mechanism for host defense against microbial infection in humans." ;

Toll receptor 9 (TLR9) is an important pattern recognition receptor. It is stimulated by foreign DNA or CpG motivs. 

We found that TLR9 -/- mice were very susceptible to infection with the mouse pox virus Ectromelia. In contrast to DC from C57Bl/6 mice, DC from TLR9 -/- produced little if any interferon alpha. However, MVA-BN induced IFNalpha in presence or absence of TLR9 -/-. Moreover, coinfection with MVA-BN and Ectromilia protected TLR9 -/- mice against death. Surprisingly, coinfection with MVA-BN and Ectromilia also protected IFNalpha receptor -/- mice. The data show that MVA-BN can induce potent innate immune responses able to control viral replication to allow the specific immune response to eliminate Ectromelia in immune deficient mice.

We furthermore defined that protection by using the attenuated Vaccinia virus MVA to protect mice against poxvirus infection, if used before or at the onset of infection, partially depends on the induction of the antiviral cytokines IFN- type I, but fully depends on the presence of adaptive immune responses. Importantly we were able to demonstrate that post-exposure application for up to three days of MVA rescued mousepox virus infected mice from death. This is the first demonstration of the effectiveness of post-exposure vaccination against pathogenic poxviruses.

We will explore the innate and adaptive immune elements involved in the protection.""" ;

      dc:description "Here, we review a novel vaccine modality, characterized by the administration of long (23 to 45 amino acids) synthetic peptides in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (mineral oil based, Montanide ISA-51), delivered subcutaneously. Such vaccines were first demonstrated to be much more potent in preclinical T-cell response induction and tumor therapy experiments than were short major histocompatibility complex class I-binding peptides. Nevertheless, a recent study has shown the clinical efficacy of an anchor-modified short gp100 peptide in melanoma patients. We now review the evidence and mode of action of a long peptide vaccine consisting of 13 overlapping peptides, together covering the entire length of the 2 oncogenic proteins E6 and E7 of high-risk human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV16), causing complete regression of all lesions and eradicating virus in 9 of 20 women with high-grade vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. The nature and strength of the vaccine-induced T-cell response correlated significantly with the clinical response. This vaccine promises to be of use not only in patients with premalignant lesions caused by high-risk HPV16 but also in malignant tumors caused by this virus, including HPV16-positive cervical cancer, vulvar cancer, anal cancer, and head and neck cancer." ;

      dc:description "Summary:  From the very early days of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) research, it was recognized that different protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms might be involved in the activation of NF-κB. Pharmacological tools and pseudosubstrate inhibitors suggested that these kinases play a role in this important inflammatory and survival pathway; however, it was the analysis of several genetic mouse knockout models that revealed the complexity and interrelations between the different components of the PB1 network in several cellular functions, including T-cell biology, bone homeostasis, inflammation associated with the metabolic syndrome, and cancer. These studies unveiled, for example, the critical role of PKCζ as a positive regulator of NF-κB through the regulation of RelA but also its inflammatory suppressor activities through the regulation of the interleukin-4 signaling cascade. This observation is of relevance in T cells, where p62, PKCζ, PKCλ/ι, and NBR1 establish a mesh of interactions that culminate in the regulation of T-cell effector responses through the modulation of T-cell polarity. Many questions remain to be answered, not just from the point of view of the implication for NF-κB activation but also with regard to the in vivo interplay between these pathways in pathophysiological processes like obesity and cancer." ;

      dc:description "Rationale: Cigarette smoke (CS) is the main causative factor of COPD. Current dogma supports the concept that airway inflammation is central to the development and progression of the disease. Studies have demonstrated that neutrophils are increased in COPD lungs and that neutrophil-associated products correlate with the development and severity of COPD. The peptide fMLP (N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine) is an active component of CS. fMLP interacts on the neutrophil and macrophage membranes with a high-affinity receptor subtype (FPR1) and with a low-affinity subtype FPRL1 promoting a chemotactic response, superoxide anion production and degranulation. Bacterial colonization of the lower respiratory tract and lung cell damage may represent further sources of formyl peptides in patients with COPD. Objectives: To investigate the role of FPR in a mouse model on lung inflammation and emphysema induced by CS.Methods, Measurements and Main Results: Here, we report the novel observation that genetic ablation of the FPR1 gene (Fpr1) confers protection from smoking-induced lung emphysema in mice. Compared to wild type mice, Fpr1 knockout mice displayed marked decreases in the lung migration of neutrophil and macrophage after exposure to CS. Upon transgenic approach, the changes in cell numbers were accompanied by marked modulation of the expression of genes implicated in the inflammatory response. Administration of the FPR1 antagonist cyclosporine H to WT mice attenuated the acute inflammatory response evoked by CS. Conclusions: These findings may have clinical significance, as both current smokers and subjects with emphysema showed increased FPRs expression in bronchoalveolar fluids and on peripheral neutrophils. Modulating FPR1 signal should be explored as potential new therapy." ;

      dc:description "An alginate lyase gene of a newly isolated Pseudomonas sp. strain KS-408 was cloned by using PCR with the specific primers designed from homologous nucleotide sequences. A partial protein sequence of KS-408 alginate lyase was homology-modeled on the basis of the crystal structure of A1-III alginate lyase from Sphingomonas sp. strain A1. The proposed 3-D structure of KS-408 alginate lyase shows that Asn-198, His-199, Arg-246, and Tyr-253 residues are conserved for the catalytic active site. The recombinant KS-408-1F (with signal peptide) and KS-408-2F (without signal peptide) alginate lyases with the (His)(6) tag consist of 393 (44.5 kDa) and 372 (42.4 kDa) amino acids with isoelectric points of 8.64 and 8.46, respectively. The purified recombinant KS-408 alginate lyase was very stable when it was incubated at 40 °C for 30 min. Alginate oligosaccharides produced by the KS-408-2F alginate lyase were purified on a Bio-Gel P2 column and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography, fast-protein liquid chromatography, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. (1)H NMR data showed that the KS-408-2F alginate lyase cleaved the glycosidic linkages between two mannuronates (mannuronate-β(1-4)-mannuronate) or mannuronate and guluronate (mannuronate-β(1-4)-guluronate), indicating that the KS-408 alginate lyase is a polyM-specific lyase." ;

      dc:description "Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), a constituent of edible cruciferous vegetables, inhibits growth of breast cancer cells but the mechanisms underlying growth inhibitory effect of BITC are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that BITC treatment causes FoxO1-mediated autophagic death in cultured human breast cancer cells. The BITC-treated breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, MDA-MB-468, BT-474, and BRI-JM04) and MDA-MB-231 xenografts from BITC-treated mice exhibited several features characteristic of autophagy, including appearance of double-membrane vacuoles (transmission electron microscopy) and acidic vesicular organelles (acridine orange staining), cleavage of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), and/or suppression of p62 (p62/SQSTM1 or sequestosome 1) expression. On the other hand, a normal human mammary epithelial cell line (MCF-10A) was resistant to BITC-induced autophagy. BITC-mediated inhibition of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell viability was partially but statistically significantly attenuated in the presence of autophagy inhibitors 3-methyl adenine and bafilomycin A1. Stable overexpression of Mn-superoxide dismutase, which was fully protective against apoptosis, conferred only partial protection against BITC-induced autophagy. BITC treatment decreased phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream targets (P70s6k and 4E-BP1) in cultured MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-231 xenografts, but activation of mTOR by transient overexpression of its positive regulator Rheb failed to confer protection against BITC-induced autophagy. Autophagy induction by BITC was associated with increased expression and acetylation of FoxO1. Furthermore, autophagy induction and cell growth inhibition resulting from BITC exposure were significantly attenuated by small interfering RNA knockdown of FoxO1. In conclusion, the present study provides novel insights into the molecular circuitry of BITC-induced cell death involving FoxO1-mediated autophagy." ;

      rdfs:comment """We have obtained data from an analysis of the uptake, conservation and cross-presentation of the model antigen OVA after Fc receptor-mediated uptake by DC and from an analysis of the immunological consequences of the antigen depot. 

We found that MHC class I presentation is relatively short-lived in contrast to MHC class II. However, CD8 cross-priming capacity of OVA-loaded DC was functionally retained for many days, while peptide-pulsed DC had lost their priming capacity after 24 hours. Strikingly, OVA protein antigen was conserved intracellularly in DC for many days. Antigen-derived peptide presentation was efficiently restored after peptide elution from MHC class I at the cell surface, providing a strong association between intracellular antigen depot and the prolonged cross-priming potency of DC. Characterization of the storage compartments shows that these resemble lysosome-like structures, distinct from MHC class II loading compartments. We speculate that DC have adapted an endogenous compartment facilitating prolonged MHC class I presentation from exogenous antigen for effective CD8 T cell cross-priming. 

We have further analyzed the immunological consequences of the antigen depot. T cells that were induced by dendritic cells several days after a short antigen pulse had full proliferative capacity and could kill tumors in vivo. Furthermore, we studies the mechanism of cross-presentation of antigen from the antigen depot. By using inhibitors for the proteasome, we observed that the proteasome is crucial in the presentation of the antigen in MHC class I. 

By using TAP deficient cells, we found that TAP is also necessary for this process. We further characterized the antigen depot by confocal microscopy and found that the antigen co-localized with the lysosomal marker LAMP1, but not with the endosomal marker EEA1, TAP, MHC class I or MHC class II. We conclude that the antigen depot is a storage compartment and not a loading compartment. We have started to examine depot formation by targeting antigen to other receptors. For example, we have found that presentation of TLR ligand- long peptide conjugates was also long-lived, while presentation of OVA, targeted via the mannose receptor, was not long-lived.

We will address the requirement of antigen depot formation in dendritic cells for effective tumor elimination, by pulse-loading experiments of short and long peptides, whole protein immune complexes and TLRL-conjugated peptides. Our goal is to better understand the molecular requirements for antigen depot formation in dendritic cells. To accomplish this, we will further characterize the antigen storage compartment by proteomics. In addition, we want to address the mechanism of processing and presentation in MHC class I and MHC class II from the antigen depot in more detail. Furthermore, we plan to address the question why antigen is not degraded as would be expected in compartments with lysosomal characteristics.""" ;

ACEA has no effect on amyloid-β (Aβ) production, aggregation, or clearance. However, ACEA reduces the cytotoxic effect of Aβ42 oligomers in primary cultures of cortical neurons, and reverses Aβ-induced dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) in vitro and in vivo. Reduced activity of GSK3β in ACEA-treated mice is further supported by the reduced amount of phospho-tau (Thr181) in neuritic processes around Aβ plaques. In addition, ACEA-treated mice show decreased astroglial response in the vicinity of Aβ plaques and decreased expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-γ in astrocytes when compared with age-matched vehicle-treated transgenic mice. Our present results show a beneficial effect of ACEA at both the neuronal, mediated at least in part by GSK3β inhibition, and glial levels, resulting in a reduction of reactive astrocytes and lower expression of interferon-γ. As a consequence, targeting the CB1 receptor could offer a versatile approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease." ;

We report in this study a novel NKR-P1B(bright) NK subpopulation that is prevalent in peripheral blood, liver, and gut-associated lymphoid organs and scarce in the spleen, peripheral lymph nodes, bone marrow, and lungs. This NKR-P1B(bright) NK subset displays an activated phenotype, expressing CD25, CD93, CX(3)CR1 and near absence of CD62-L, CD11b, and CD27. Functionally, NKR-P1B(bright) NK cells are highly responsive in terms of IFN-γ production and exert potent cytolytic activity. They show little spontaneous proliferation, are reduced in numbers upon in vivo activation with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, and have poor survival in ex vivo cytokine cultures. Our findings suggest that NKR-P1B(bright) NK cells are fully differentiated effector cells that rapidly die upon further activation. The identification of this novel rat NK cell subset may facilitate future translational research of the role of distinct NK cell subsets under normal physiological conditions and during ongoing immune responses." ;

We have efficiently transfected DC with RNA encoding a functional protein (E/L-selectin), which allows entry of DC into LN from HEV. These DC rolled in vitro on sialyl-LewisX-coated slides, and in vivo, mouse E/L-selectin-transfected DC homed to LN after i.v. application. Monocyte-derived and cocktail-matured DC electroporated with a combination of RNAs encoding tumor antigens (MelanA, Mage3, Survivin) and E/L-selectin are currently used in a clinical trial. To increase RNA stability and to obtain a longer-lasting expression of E/L-selectin on DC, thereby providing a higher chance that DC can migraten efficiently to LN, the RNA was modified by introducing different RNA caps, introducing different 3’ UTRs, and by elongation of the poly A tail. Furthermore, mouse experiments have been started in collaboration with P02 to perform quantification of E/L-selectin-transfected DC that migrated into LN by labelling these cells with Indium or SPIO beads.  

Immunomonitoring of this trial was based on ELISPOT assays with overlapping peptides covering the whole protein sequence of the tumor antigens MageA3, MelanA and Survivin. Most patients already demonstrated broad responses to numerous peptides prior vaccination. Significantly enhanced responses to several peptides and occurrence of new responses was seen in 6 patients, 5 of which were vaccinated with E/L-S+ DC. These data provide evidence for a superior immunopotency of  E/L-selectin expressing DC. The distribution of i.v. given DC is currently being analyzed using Indium labelling.""" ;

This analysis for the first time showed a clinical correlation of induced immune responses as measured in the blood with outcome, as there have been so far statistically significantly less events in stage III patients showing good CTL reponses (IFN-y Elispot) to multiple class I and II peptides compared to low responders of the stage III cohort. Additional in vitro maturation of DC by CD40L (leucine zipper, Immunex) did not result in better immunity compard to standard cytokine cocktail matured DC.

The trial was closed in 2007. Ongoing monitoring has confirmed a clinical correlation of induced immunes responses. In stage IV patients very rapidly progressing patients showed in general weak immune responses after the first vaccinations. The strength and breadth of induced immune responses was, however, identical in patients living up to 24 months or significantly beyond 24 months. Interestingly, we could distinguish between these two groups by transcriptome analysis of pre-vaccination metastases in that long survivors had a preexisting “friendly” non-suppressive micromilieu. This is obviously an exciting finding and will influence future study design, and possibly allow a preselection of  patients responsive to immune intervention.""" ;

The nearly perfect spherical particles (beads) with the dimensions in the range of 10-500 nm were obtained depending on the main process parameters (precursor concentration, temperature, and time). The particles size, surface morphology, structure, and composition have been examined by TEM, SEM, X-ray diffraction, XPS, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. These amorphous carbonaceous nanobeads (a-CNBs) have been found nontoxic in vitro with a variety of cultured cell lines. The size-dependent effect of a-CNBs addition on cell function has been observed. For example, a-CNBs can, in some cases, substantially increase interleukin-12 (IL-12) production by bone marrow dendritic cells. It has been further demonstrated that a-CNBs can be modified with fluorescent dye molecules or loaded with anti-cancer drugs for bioimaging or therapeutic purposes, respectively. The results of these tests and the strategies for the particle preparation and functionalization for biomedical applications have been discussed." ;

Ex vivo lentivirally transduced dendritic cells (DC) have been described to induce CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses against various tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) in vitro and in vivo. 

We report here that direct administration of ovalbumin (OVA) encoding lentiviral vectors caused in vivo transduction of cells that were found in draining lymph nodes (LNs) and induced potent anti-OVA cytotoxic T cells similar to those elicited by ex vivo transduced DC. The cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response following direct injection of lentiviral vectors was highly effective in eliminating target cells in vivo up to 30 days after immunization and was efficiently recalled after a boost immunization. Injection of lentiviral vectors furthermore activated OVA-specific CD4+ T cells and this CD4 help was shown to be necessary for an adequate primary and memory CTL response. When tested in therapeutic tumor experiments with OVA+ melanoma cells, direct administration of lentiviral vectors slowed down tumor growth to a comparable extent with the highest dose of ex vivo transduced DC. Taken together, these data indicate that direct in vivo administration of lentiviral vectors encoding TAAs has strong potential for anticancer vaccination.""" ;

      dc:description "Homeostatic control of dendritic cell (DC) survival is crucial for adaptive immunity, but the molecular mechanism is not well defined. Moreover, how DCs influence immune homeostasis under steady state remains unclear. Combining DC-specific and -inducible deletion systems, we report that transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is an essential regulator of DC survival and immune system homeostasis and function. Deficiency of TAK1 in CD11c(+) cells induced markedly elevated apoptosis, leading to the depletion of DC populations, especially the CD8(+) and CD103(+) DC subsets in lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues, respectively. TAK1 also contributed to DC development by promoting the generation of DC precursors. Prosurvival signals from Toll-like receptors, CD40 and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK) are integrated by TAK1 in DCs, which in turn mediated activation of downstream NF-κB and AKT-Foxo pathways and established a gene-expression program. TAK1 deficiency in DCs caused a myeloid proliferative disorder characterized by expansion of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes, disrupted T-cell homeostasis, and prevented effective T-cell priming and generation of regulatory T cells. Moreover, TAK1 signaling in DCs was required to prevent myeloid proliferation even in the absence of lymphocytes, indicating a previously unappreciated regulatory mechanism of DC-mediated control of myeloid cell-dependent inflammation. Therefore, TAK1 orchestrates a prosurvival checkpoint in DCs that affects the homeostasis and function of the immune system." ;

      dc:description "We previously showed a preferential degradation and down-regulation of mitochondrial DNA and RNA in hamster fibroblasts in response to hydrogen peroxide. Subsequent studies by others demonstrated that mitochondrial DNA can stimulate immune cells as a DAMP (damage associated molecular patterns) family member. However, the actual physical structure of this mitochondrial DNA DAMP and its importance in non-immune cell types are poorly understood. Here we report that transfected oxidant-initiated degraded mitochondrial polynucleotides, which we term \"DeMPs\", strongly induce the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and tumor necrosis factor α in mouse primary astrocytes. Additionally, proinflammatory IL1β was induced, implicating DeMPs in inflammasome activation. Furthermore, human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma were found to contain detectable DeMP signal. Finally, significant degradation of mitochondrial DNA was observed in response to either a bolus or steady state hydrogen peroxide. Combined, these studies demonstrate, all for the first time, that a pathophysiologically relevant form of mitochondrial DNA (degraded) can elicit a proinflammatory cytokine induction; that a brain cell type (astrocytes) elicits a proinflammatory cytokine induction in response to these DeMPs; that this induction includes the inflammasome; that astrocytes are capable of inflammasome activation by DeMPs; that DeMPs are detectable in CSF and plasma; and that hydrogen peroxide can stimulate an early stage cellular degradation of mitochondrial DNA. These results provide new insights and are supportive of our hypothesis that DeMPs are a newly identified trigger of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, which are known to be associated with early stage inflammation and oxidation." ;

      dc:description "Nanocrystalline CaCu3Ti4O12 powders with particle sizes of 39.28 8.12 nm were synthesized by a simple modify sol-gel using PVP (Poly-vinyl-pyrrolidone). The synthesized precursor was characterized by TG-DTA to determine the thermal decomposition and crystallization temperature which was found to be at above 500 degrees C. The precursor was calcined at 800 degrees C in air for 8 h to obtain nanocrystalline powders of CaCu3Ti4O12. The calcined CaCu3Ti4O12 powders were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM and TEM. Sintering of the powders was conducted in air at 1100 degrees C for 16 h. The XRD results indicated that all sintered samples have a typical perovskite CaCu3Ti4O12 structure and a small amount of CaTiO3. SEM micrographs showed the average grain sizes of 1.86 +/- 0.69 /m for the sintered CaCu3Ti4O12 ceramic prepared using the CaCu3Ti4O12 powders calcined at 800 degrees C. The sintered samples exhibit a giant dielectric constant, epsilon' of approximately 10(3)-10(4). The large low-frequency dielectric permittivity at low temperature is closely related to sub-grain boundary distribution, including conductivity effect. Furthermore, the ceramic shows three semicircles in the complex impedance plane. However, at low frequency, semicircles of sub-grain boundary and grain boundary are considered to represent collapse different electrical mechanisms. The another is ascribed to the contribution of grain. The dielectric behavior at several frequencies and temperatures of these samples can be attributed to electronic inhomogeneities present in material and can be explained based on a microstructural model." ;

Weeks to months following the onset of Lyme borreliosis, a histopathological reaction characteristic of synovitis including bone, joint, muscle, or tendon pain may occur. A subpopulation of patients may progress to a chronic, debilitating arthritis months to years after infection which has been classified as severe destructive Lyme arthritis. This arthritis involves focal bone erosion and destruction of articular cartilage. Hamsters and mice are animal models that have been utilized to study articular manifestations of Lyme borreliosis. Infection of immunocompetent LSH hamsters or C3H mice results in a transient synovitis. However, severe destructive Lyme arthritis can be induced by infecting irradiated hamsters or mice and immunocompetent Borrelia-vaccinated hamsters, mice, and interferon-gamma- (IFN-γ-) deficient mice with viable B. burgdorferi. The hamster model of severe destructive Lyme arthritis facilitates easy assessment of Lyme borreliosis vaccine preparations for deleterious effects while murine models of severe destructive Lyme arthritis allow for investigation of mechanisms of immunopathology." ;

      dc:description "A balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms at mucosal interfaces, which are sites of constitutive exposure to microbes and non-microbial foreign substances, allows for efficient protection against pathogens yet prevents adverse inflammatory responses associated with allergy, asthma and intestinal inflammation. Regulatory T (T(reg)) cells prevent systemic and tissue-specific autoimmunity and inflammatory lesions at mucosal interfaces. These cells are generated in the thymus (tT(reg) cells) and in the periphery (induced (i)T(reg) cells), and their dual origin implies a division of labour between tT(reg) and iT(reg) cells in immune homeostasis. Here we show that a highly selective blockage in differentiation of iT(reg) cells in mice did not lead to unprovoked multi-organ autoimmunity, exacerbation of induced tissue-specific autoimmune pathology, or increased pro-inflammatory responses of T helper 1 (T(H)1) and T(H)17 cells. However, mice deficient in iT(reg) cells spontaneously developed pronounced T(H)2-type pathologies at mucosal sites--in the gastrointestinal tract and lungs--with hallmarks of allergic inflammation and asthma. Furthermore, iT(reg)-cell deficiency altered gut microbial communities. These results suggest that whereas T(reg) cells generated in the thymus appear sufficient for control of systemic and tissue-specific autoimmunity, extrathymic differentiation of T(reg) cells affects commensal microbiota composition and serves a distinct, essential function in restraint of allergic-type inflammation at mucosal interfaces." ;

      dc:description "The axon guidance cues semaphorins (Semas) and their receptors plexins have been shown to regulate both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Sema4A plays an important role in the immune system by inducing T cell activation, but to date, the role of Sema4A in regulating the function of macrophages during the angiogenic and inflammatory processes remains unclear. In this study, we show that macrophage activation by TLR ligands LPS and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid induced a time-dependent increase of Sema4A and its receptors PlexinB2 and PlexinD1. Moreover, in a thioglycollate-induced peritonitis mouse model, Sema4A was detected in circulating Ly6C(high) inflammatory monocytes and peritoneal macrophages. Acting via PlexinD1, exogenous Sema4A strongly increased macrophage migration. Of note, Sema4A-activated PlexinD1 enhanced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A, but not of inflammatory chemokines. Sema4A-stimulated macrophages were able to activate vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 and the PI3K/serine/threonine kinase Akt pathway in endothelial cells and to sustain their migration and in vivo angiogenesis. Remarkably, in an in vivo cardiac ischemia/reperfusion mouse model, Sema4A was highly expressed in macrophages recruited at the injured area. We conclude that Sema4A activates a specialized and restricted genetic program in macrophages able to sustain angiogenesis and participates in their recruitment and activation in inflammatory injuries." ;

      dc:description "Although hyper-activated mTOR is well recognized as being pivotal to prostate cancer growth and progression, the underlying mechanisms by which it promotes such responses remain incompletely understood. Here we show that rapamycin activates Smads 1 and 5 in human prostate cancer cells and tissues through blocking mTORC1 kinase. ShRNA-based gene silencing and gene overexpression approaches reveal that Smads 1 and 5 mediate while Smad8 represses rapamycin-induced cell death and expression of the BMP transcriptional target Id1 in human prostate cancer cell lines. Moreover, such phospho-Smad1/5-mediated rapamycin responses were blocked by LDN-193189 (a BMPRI kinase inhibitor) or Noggin (a BMP antagonist) in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Likewise, the mTOR kinase inhibitors Ku-0063794 and WYE-354 each enhanced phosphorylation of Smad1/5. Intriguingly, silencing Raptor alone enhanced while silencing Rictor repressed the phosphorylation of Smad1/5, indicating that mTORC1 represses while mTORC2 activates BMP signaling. Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased levels of phospho-Smad1/5 concomitant with suppression of phospho-S6 and Survivin levels in PC3 human prostate cancer xenografts in athymic mice administered rapamycin (i.p., 5 mg/kg/day, 2 to 6 days). Moreover, we show that compared to prostate tumor tissue from untreated patients, levels of phospho-Smad1/5 were significantly elevated in the prostate tumor tissue of high-risk prostate cancer patients who received 8 weeks of the rapalog everolimus as part of a neoadjuvant clinical trial prior to undergoing local definitive therapy by radical prostatectomy. Taken together, our data implicate Smads 1, 5 and 8 as potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for mTOR inhibition therapy of prostate cancer." ;

Aim: To evaluate the leukocyte gene expression of progesterone receptor (PR-A/B) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), two parameters under the control of estrogens and involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Subjects: The study was conducted in non-demented women divided into two groups according to their pre- or post-menopausal state; each group being further divided into two subgroups based on their circulating levels of IGF-1 (normal or low). An additional sample of AD-affected women served as a comparison group. Results: Estrogens maintained their full activity only when IGF-1 levels were in the range of normalcy. On the contrary, if the concentrations of one or both hormones were reduced, estrogens were not anymore capable to control the gene expression of PR-A/B or IL-6. Conclusions: Before administering hormone-based replacement therapy (HRT), characterization of the somatotropic function should be performed in the early phase of the menopause." ;

      dc:description "The limited therapeutic effect of gemcitabine on pancreatic cancer is largely attributed to pre-existing or acquired resistance of the tumor cells. This study was aimed at screening for candidate resistance-related gene(s) and elucidating the underlying mechanisms. NME5 was found to be highly expressed in an innate gemcitabine-resistant human pancreatic cancer sample and the cell line PAXC002 derived from the sample. Downregulation of NME5 significantly reversed gemcitabine resistance in PAXC002 cells, whereas NME5 overexpression induced gemcitabine resistance in the pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC-3. NME5 attenuated the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest induced by gemcitabine, probably accounting for the blunted sensitivity to gemcitabine. Furthermore, NME5 was demonstrated to play its role in a nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB)-dependent manner. NME5 was capable of directly binding NF-κB, and possibly regulated its expression level in PAXC002 cells. Our results also suggest that NF-κB is a key executor of NME5 in regulating apoptosis and cell cycle. All of these data suggest that NME5 is a promising target for relieving innate gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer cells.

      dc:description "Background aims. Retroviral transduction of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptors significantly enhances the cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells against B-cell malignancies. We aimed to validate a more practical, affordable and safe method for this purpose. Methods. We tested the expression of a receptor containing CD3ζ and 4-1BB signaling molecules (anti-CD19-BB-ζ) in human NK cells after electroporation with the corresponding mRNA using a clinical-grade electroporator. The cytotoxic capacity of the transfected NK cells was tested in vitro and in a mouse model of leukemia. Results. Median anti-CD19-BB-ζ expression 24 h after electroporation was 40.3% in freshly purified (n =18) and 61.3% in expanded (n = 31) NK cells; median cell viability was 90%. NK cells expressing anti-CD19-BB-ζ secreted interferon (IFN)-γ in response to CD19-positive target cells and had increased cytotoxicity. Receptor expression was detectable 6 h after electroporation, reaching maximum levels at 24-48 h; specific anti-CD19 cytotoxicity was observed at 96 h. Levels of expression and cytotoxicities were comparable with those achieved by retroviral transduction. A large-scale protocol was developed and applied to expanded NK cells (median NK cell number 2.5 × 10(8), n = 12). Median receptor expression after 24 h was 82.0%; NK cells transfected under these conditions exerted considerable cytotoxicity in xenograft models of B-cell leukemia. Conclusions. The method described here represents a practical way to augment the cytotoxicity of NK cells against B-cell malignancies. It has the potential to be extended to other targets beyond CD19 and should facilitate the clinical use of redirected NK cells for cancer therapy." ;

Tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases respectively, are critical to the activation and propagation of these signalling cascades. Intriguingly, the removal of tyrosyl phosphate moieties from phosphorylated proteins by phosphatases can contribute to both the positive and negative regulation of signalling events. The complex and diverse roles of the individual PTP family members in immune cells, is evident by the range of immune disorders caused by PTP deficiencies. Central to several such immune disorders is the disturbance of T cell homeostasis, characterized by aberrant cell growth, survival and activation. The survival and homeostatic proliferation of naïve and memory CD8 T cells is primarily regulated by signalling events downstream of the T cell receptor complex and common γ chain cytokine receptors, events which are frequently targeted by PTP activity. The following review will discuss the primary PTPs involved in CD8 T cell homeostasis, focusing on the signalling nodes that they target. In addition, as the mechanisms which co-ordinate PTP activity are only partially understood, we will discuss currently proposed models of regulation and highlight unanswered questions." ;

We conclude that the antigen depot is a storage compartment and not a loading compartment. We have started to examine depot formation by targeting antigen to other receptors.

      rdfs:comment """Our lab has obtained data on the mechanism of how IL-10 regulates the immune response to MTb infection in mice. 

Control and clearance of intracellular pathogens such as MTb is dependent on the production of TNF and the induction of the T-helper 1 (Th1) cytokine IFN-gamma by IL-12.  Conversely, IL-10 is a suppressive cytokine essential for dampening the immune response to a number of intracellular pathogens to limit host immune pathology.  IL-10 has been shown to exert its suppressive effect by directly acting on the antigen presenting cell (APC), therefore functioning to down-regulate macrophage antimicrobial activity or the induction of Th1 responses by dendritic cells (DC).  However, during infection with pathogens such as T. gondii, IL-10 hinders pathogen clearance but is critical for blocking fatal immune pathology.  In patients with chronic tuberculosis (TB), T cells are present that produce both IL-10 and IFN-gamma and stimulation of MTb-antigen specific T cells ex-vivo in the presence of anti-IL-10 antibodies results in their increased proliferation and IFN- production.  Although this suggests a role for IL-10 in the regulation of the response to MTb, this has not been demonstrated and it is possible that a major role at this stage is to limit immune pathology in chronic disease.  To date in murine models of MTb, a role for IL-10 is controversal. 

We have identified that IL-10 plays an early and transient role in the control of the immune response to MTb and now show that this involves enhanced migration of IFNgamma producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells into the lung rather than enhanced mycobacterial killing. The effects are accompanied by enhanced G-CSF, GM-CSF, TNF, IL-6 and IL-17 levels although the enhanced clearance of bacilli in IL-10 deficient mice we now show is independent of IL-17.

The work describing the mechanism of how IL-10 regulates the immune response to MTb infection is now being completed for publication (a manuscript will be submitted for publication in the next few months; Redford, O’Garra et al., 2009). Work on determining the ability of IL-10 depletion to enhance vaccination against MTb infection is being initiated now to continue this programme, but the majority of this work is the scope of the future outside the remits of DC-THERA.""" ;

      dc:description "Numerous reports have demonstrated that CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) from individuals with a range of human autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, are deficient in their ability to control autologous proinflammatory responses when compared with nondiseased, control individuals. Treg dysfunction could be a primary, causal event or may result from perturbations in the immune system during disease development. Polymorphisms in genes associated with Treg function, such as IL2RA, confer a higher risk of autoimmune disease. Although this suggests a primary role for defective Tregs in autoimmunity, a link between IL2RA gene polymorphisms and Treg function has not been examined. We addressed this by examining the impact of an IL2RA haplotype associated with type 1 diabetes on Treg fitness and suppressive function. Studies were conducted using healthy human subjects to avoid any confounding effects of disease. We demonstrated that the presence of an autoimmune disease-associated IL2RA haplotype correlates with diminished IL-2 responsiveness in Ag-experienced CD4(+) T cells, as measured by phosphorylation of STAT5a, and is associated with lower levels of FOXP3 expression by Tregs and a reduction in their ability to suppress proliferation of autologous effector T cells. These data offer a rationale that contributes to the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which polymorphisms in the IL-2RA gene affect immune regulation, and consequently upon susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases." ;

      dc:description "In vitro systems have provided a wealth of information in the field of RNA biology, as they constitute a superior and sometimes the unique approach to address many important questions. Such cell-free methods can be sorted by the degree of complexity of the preparation of enzymatic and/or regulatory activity. Progress in the study of pre-mRNA processing has largely relied on traditional in vitro methods, as these reactions have been recapitulated in cell-free systems. The pre-mRNA capping, editing, and cleavage/polyadenylation reactions have even been reconstituted using purified components, and the enzymes responsible for catalysis have been characterized by such techniques. In vitro splicing using nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts has yielded clues on spliceosome assembly, kinetics, and mechanisms of splicing and has been essential to elucidate the function of splicing factors. Coupled systems have been important to functionally connect distinct processes, like transcription and splicing. Extract preparation has also been adapted to cells from a variety of tissues and species, revealing general versus species-specific mechanisms. Cell-free assays have also been applied to newly discovered pathways such as those involving small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). The first two pathways have been well characterized largely by in vitro methods, which need to be developed for piRNAs. Finally, new techniques, such as single-molecule studies, are continuously being established, providing new and important insights into the field. Thus, in vitro approaches have been, are, and will continue being at the forefront of RNA research.

      dc:description "BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysm is considered an atherosclerosis-related disease, but the mechanisms underlying abdominal aortic aneurysm remain poorly defined. Despite the large number of cytokines identified in an aneurysm sample, the relative importance of particular cytokines in aneurysm formation is unknown. We have studied the production of interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 cytokines in plasma and cultures of abdominal aortic aneurysm explant samples obtained from patients subjected to elective surgery and their correlation with cellular composition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inflammatory cells from the abdominal aortic aneurysm samples were phenotypically characterized using specific monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD3, -CD4, -CD8, -CD19, -CD38, -CD68, -HLA-DR) by means of immunocytochemistry staining. Production of interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 in culture supernatants of abdominal aortic aneurysm explant samples expanded in vitro for 24 h was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: We showed that the levels of interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 in supernatants of abdominal aortic aneurysm sample cultures were higher by 73 and 86 times compared to their levels in plasma, respectively. In individual abdominal aortic aneurysm explant cultures, a negative correlation between interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 production was observed. Such inverse correlation was not detected in plasma. Based on these results, we divided abdominal aortic aneurysm into two cytokine-producing groups and showed that the interleukin-6(hi)/interleukin-10(lo) group contained higher percentages of granulocytes, HLA-DR(+), and CD68(+) cells but lower percentages of lymphocytes and plasma cells compared to the interleukin-6(lo)/interleukin-10(hi) group. Exogenously added interleukin-10 suppresses the production of interleukin-6 by abdominal aortic aneurysm explants. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 may have a different role in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm." ;

We thus should be able to detect the cells that capture, degrade and present this antigen to T cells. Since we had previously generated a monoclonal antibody, 2C44, that reacts to a peptide derived from the Leishmania LACK protein bound to I-Ad MHC class II molecules, we chose to use LACK as a model antigen in these experiments. We have thus prepared two plasmids coding for LACK linked to either eGFP or mCherry fluorescent proteins, under the control of the beta-casein promoter. These constructs have been injected into fertilized eggs and transgenic animals are expected for march 2009. " ;

      dc:description "During inflammation and in transplantable tumor models, natural killer (NK) cells are recruited to pathologic tissues and activated to produce proinflammatory cytokines favoring adaptive immune responses of the T-helper type 1 (Th1) type. Interferon (IFN)-γ is needed to induce chemokines that attract NK cells in transplanted tumors. Nothing, however, is known on NK-cell migration in spontaneous tumors. As effective recruitment is a prerequisite for therapeutic NK-cell transfer, we investigated the cytokine milieu and the mechanisms that are instrumental for NK-cell accumulation in an endogenous tumor model. We make use of λ-myc transgenic mice that harbor the c-myc oncogene and develop spontaneous B-cell lymphoma. In contrast to lymphomas induced by tumor cell injection, virtually no IFN-γ produced by NK or by other cells was present in the tumor environment, particularly in advanced stages. Dendritic cells showed an impaired expression of interleukin-12, which is suggestive of deficient Th1 priming. The IFN-γ-dependent chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 were pivotal for NK-cell migration in the endogenous lymphoma model. Although IFN-γ was absent in late tumor stages, there was still expression of CXCL9 and CXCL10 with an ongoing influx of NK cells. The results demonstrate that transplantable tumor models do not reflect the situation as found in endogenously arising neoplasia, because in the latter, effective Th1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses are presumably not induced because of impaired IFN-γ production. The data also suggest that CXCL9 and CXCL10 production and NK-cell migration become independent of IFN-γ during tumor progression, and therefore support approaches of adoptive NK-cell transfer that hold promise for treatment of cancer." ;

      dc:description "Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is an antiapoptotic transcription factor. We show that the antiapoptotic actions of NF-κB are mediated by hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) synthesized by cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE). TNF-α treatment triples H(2)S generation by stimulating binding of SP1 to the CSE promoter. H(2)S generated by CSE stimulates DNA binding and gene activation of NF-κB, processes that are abolished in CSE-deleted mice. As CSE deletion leads to decreased glutathione levels, resultant oxidative stress may contribute to alterations in CSE mutant mice. H(2)S acts by sulfhydrating the p65 subunit of NF-κB at cysteine-38, which promotes its binding to the coactivator ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3). Sulfhydration of p65 predominates early after TNF-α treatment, then declines and is succeeded by a reciprocal enhancement of p65 nitrosylation. In CSE mutant mice, antiapoptotic influences of NF-κB are markedly diminished. Thus, sulfhydration of NF-κB appears to be a physiologic determinant of its antiapoptotic transcriptional activity." ;

      dc:description "It was hypothesized that the EBV-specific CD8(+) T cell response may be dysregulated in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, possibly leading to a suboptimal control of this virus. To examine the CD8(+) T cell response in greater detail, we analyzed the HLA-A2-, HLA-B7-, and HLA-B8-restricted EBV- and CMV-specific CD8(+) T cell responses in a high number of MS patients and control subjects using tetramers. Content in cytolytic granules, as well as cytotoxic activity, of EBV- and CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells was assessed. We found that MS patients had a lower or a higher prevalence of HLA-A2 and HLA-B7, respectively. Using HLA class I tetramers in HLA-B7(+) MS patients, there was a higher prevalence of MS patients with HLA-B*0702/EBV(RPP)-specific CD8(+) T cells ex vivo. However, the magnitude of the HLA-B*0702/EBV(RPP)-specific and HLA-B*0702/CMV(TPR)-specific CD8(+) T cell response (i.e., the percentage of tetramer(+) CD8(+) T cells in a study subject harboring CD8(+) T cells specific for the given epitope) was lower in MS patients. No differences were found using other tetramers. After stimulation with the HLA-B*0702/EBV(RPP) peptide, the production of IL-2, perforin, and granzyme B and the cytotoxicity of HLA-B*0702/EBV(RPP)-specific CD8(+) T cells were decreased. Altogether, our findings suggest that the HLA-B*0702-restricted viral (in particular the EBV one)-specific CD8(+) T cell response is dysregulated in MS patients. This observation is particularly interesting knowing that the HLA-B7 allele is more frequently expressed in MS patients and considering that EBV is associated with MS." ;

When excluding the 52 samples flagged for the presence of pathologic leukocytes, these correlations were found to be 0.84, 0.90, and 0.57, respectively.

      dc:description "For subunit vaccines, adjuvants play a key role in shaping immunological memory. Nanoparticle (NP) delivery systems for antigens and/or molecular danger signals are promising adjuvants capable of promoting both cellular and humoral immune responses, but in most cases the mechanisms of action of these materials are poorly understood. Here, we studied the immune response elicited by NPs composed of multilamellar \"stapled\" lipid vesicles carrying a recombinant Plasmodium vivax circumsporozoite antigen, VMP001, both entrapped in the aqueous core and anchored to the lipid bilayer surfaces. Immunization with these particles and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), a US Food and Drug Administration-approved immunostimulatory agonist for Toll-like receptor-4, promoted high-titer, high-avidity antibody responses against VMP001, lasting more than 1 y in mice at 10-fold lower doses than conventional adjuvants. Compared to soluble VMP001 mixed with MPLA, VMP001-NPs promoted broader humoral responses, targeting multiple epitopes of the protein and a more balanced Th1/Th2 cytokine profile from antigen-specific T cells. To begin to understand the underlying mechanisms, we examined components of the B-cell response and found that NPs promoted robust germinal center (GC) formation at low doses of antigen where no GC induction occurred with soluble protein immunization, and that GCs nucleated near depots of NPs accumulating in the draining lymph nodes over time. In parallel, NP vaccination enhanced the expansion of antigen-specific follicular helper T cells (T(fh)), compared to vaccinations with soluble VMP001 or alum. Thus, NP vaccines may be a promising strategy to enhance the durability, breadth, and potency of humoral immunity by enhancing key elements of the B-cell response." ;

Lung-derived microvesicles (LDMVs) also change marrow cell phenotype by inducing them to express pulmonary epithelial cell-specific mRNA and protein. These changes are accentuated when microvesicles isolated from injured lung. We wish to determine if microvesicle-treated stem/progenitor cell phenotype is linked to cell cycle and to the injury status of the lung providing microvesicles. Lineage depleted, Sca-1+ (Lin-/Sca-1+) marrow isolated from mice were cultured with interleukin 3 (IL-3), IL-6, IL-11, and stem cell factor (cytokine-cultured cells), removed at hours zero (cell cycle phase G0/G1), 24 (late G1/early S), and 48 (late S/early G2/M), and cocultured with lung tissue, lung conditioned media (LCM), or LDMV from irradiated or nonirradiated mice. Alternatively, Lin-/Sca-1+ cells not exposed to exogenous cytokines were separated into G0/G1 and S/G2/M cell cycle phase populations by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and used in coculture. Separately, LDMV from irradiated and nonirradiated mice were analyzed for the presence of adhesion proteins. Peak pulmonary epithelial cell-specific mRNA expression was seen in G0/G1 cytokine-cultured cells cocultured with irradiated lung and in late G1/early S cells cocultured with nonirradiated lung. The same pattern was seen in cytokine-cultured Lin-/Sca-1 cells cocultured with LCM and LDMV and when FACS-separated Lin-/Sca-1 cells unexposed to exogenous cytokines were used in coculture. Cells and LDMV expressed adhesion proteins whose levels differed based on cycle status (cells) or radiation injury (LDMV), suggesting a mechanism for microvesicle entry. These data demonstrate that microvesicle modification of progenitor/stem cells is influenced by cell cycle and the treatment of the originator lung tissue." ;

      dc:description "Previous studies have revealed that HIV-infected individuals possess circulating CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive (DP) T cells specific for HIV Ags. In the present study, we analyzed the proliferation and functional profile of circulating DP T cells from 30 acutely HIV-infected individuals and 10 chronically HIV-infected viral controllers. The acutely infected group had DP T cells that showed more proliferative capability and multifunctionality than did both their CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. DP T cells were found to exhibit greater proliferation and higher multifunctionality compared with CD4 T cells in the viral controller group. The DP T cell response represented 16% of the total anti-HIV proliferative response and >70% of the anti-HIV multifunctional response in the acutely infected subjects. Proliferating DP T cells of the acutely infected subjects responded to all HIV Ag pools with equal magnitude. Conversely, the multifunctional response was focused on the pool representing Nef, Rev, Tat, VPR, and VPU. Meanwhile, the controllers' DP T cells focused on Gag and the Nef, Rev, Tat, VPR, and VPU pool for both their proliferative and multifunctional responses. Finally, we show that the presence of proliferating DP T cells following all HIV Ag stimulations is well correlated with proliferating CD4 T cells whereas multifunctionality appears to be largely independent of multifunctionality in other T cell compartments. Therefore, DP T cells represent a highly reactive cell population during acute HIV infection, which responds independently from the traditional T cell compartments." ;

GM-CSF assembles and activates its heterodimeric receptor complex on the surface of myeloid cells, initiating multiple signaling pathways that control key functions such as cell survival, cell proliferation, and functional activation. Understanding the molecular composition of these pathways, the interaction of the various components as well as the kinetics and dose-dependent mechanics of receptor activation provides valuable insights into the function of GM-CSF as well as the related cytokines, interleukin-3 and interleukin-5. This knowledge provides opportunities for the development of new therapies to block the action of these cytokines in hematological malignancy and chronic inflammation." ;

Methods: Maternal blood was collected for determination of the C-reactive protein (CRP) level and white blood cell (WBC) count immediately after amniocentesis in 171 consecutive women with PPROMs. Intra-amniotic infection and/or inflammation was defined as a positive amniotic fluid (AF) culture and/or an elevated AF interleukin 6 level (≥2.6 ng/mL). Results: A risk score based on a model including maternal blood CRP, WBC, parity, and gestational age was calculated for each patient. The model was shown to have an adequate goodness of fit (P = .516), and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.848, indicating very good discrimination. Conclusion: The noninvasive model based on maternal blood CRP, WBC, parity, and gestational age is highly predictive of IAI in women with PPROMs." ;

      dc:description "BACKGROUND: Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is a severely debilitating disease of unknown pathogenesis consisting of a variety of symptoms including severe fatigue. The objective of the study was to examine the efficacy and safety of a TLR-3 agonist, rintatolimod (Poly I: C(12)U), in patients with debilitating CFS/ME. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A Phase III prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing twice weekly IV rintatolimod versus placebo was conducted in 234 subjects with long-standing, debilitating CFS/ME at 12 sites. The primary endpoint was the intra-patient change from baseline at Week 40 in exercise tolerance (ET). Secondary endpoints included concomitant drug usage, the Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), Activities of Daily Living (ADL), and Vitality Score (SF 36). Subjects receiving rintatolimod for 40 weeks improved intra-patient placebo-adjusted ET 21.3% (p = 0.047) from baseline in an intention-to-treat analysis. Correction for subjects with reduced dosing compliance increased placebo-adjusted ET improvement to 28% (p = 0.022). The improvement observed represents approximately twice the minimum considered medically significant by regulatory agencies. The rintatolimod cohort vs. placebo also reduced dependence on drugs commonly used by patients in an attempt to alleviate the symptoms of CFS/ME (p = 0.048). Placebo subjects crossed-over to receive rintatolimod demonstrated an intra-patient improvement in ET performance at 24 weeks of 39% (p = 0.04). Rintatolimod at 400 mg twice weekly was generally well-tolerated. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Rintatolimod produced objective improvement in ET and a reduction in CFS/ME related concomitant medication usage as well as other secondary outcomes.

      dc:description "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The various classes of small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression across divergent types of organisms. While a rapidly increasing number of sncRNAs has been identified over recent years, the isolation of sncRNAs of low abundance remains challenging. Virally encoded sncRNAs, particularly those of RNA viruses, can be expressed at very low levels. This is best illustrated by HIV-1 where virus encoded sncRNAs represent approximately 0.1-1.0% of all sncRNAs in HIV-1 infected cells or were found to be undetected. Thus, we applied a novel, sequence targeted enrichment strategy to capture HIV-1 derived sncRNAs in HIV-1 infected primary CD4+ T-lymphocytes and macrophages that allows a greater than 100-fold enrichment of low abundant sncRNAs. RESULTS: Eight hundred and ninety-two individual HIV-1 sncRNAs were cloned and sequenced from nine different sncRNA libraries derived from five independent experiments. These clones represent up to 90% of all sncRNA clones in the generated libraries. Two hundred and sixteen HIV-1 sncRNAs were distinguishable as unique clones. They are spread throughout the HIV-1 genome, however, forming certain clusters, and almost 10% show an antisense orientation. The length of HIV-1 sncRNAs varies between 16 and 89 nucleotides with an unexpected peak at 31 to 50 nucleotides, thus, longer than cellular microRNAs or short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Exemplary HIV-1 sncRNAs were also generated in cells infected with different primary HIV-1 isolates and can inhibit HIV-1 replication. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-1 infected cells generate virally encoded sncRNAs, which might play a role in the HIV-1 life cycle. Furthermore, the enormous capacity to enrich low abundance sncRNAs in a sequence specific manner highly recommends our selection strategy for any type of investigation where origin or target sequences of the sought-after sncRNAs are known." ;

      dc:description "Previously, we demonstrated that extracellular zinc plays a key role in transient global ischemia-induced microglial activation through sequential activation of NADPH oxidase and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1. However, it remains unclear how zinc causes the sequential activation of microglia. Here, we examined whether transporter-mediated zinc uptake is necessary for microglial activation. Administration of zinc to microglia activated them through reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) formation, which were suppressed by intracellular zinc chelation with 25 μM TPEN (N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine) or 2 μM BAPTA-AM (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester). The (65)Zn uptake by microglia was temperature- and dose-dependent, and it was blocked by metal cations, but not by L-type calcium channel blockers nifedipine and nimodipine. Expression of Zrt-Irt-like protein (ZIP)1, a plasma membrane-type zinc transporter, was detected in microglia, and nickel, a relatively sensitive substrate/inhibitor of ZIP1, showed cis- and trans-inhibitory effects on the (65)Zn uptake. Exposure of microglia to zinc increased the extracellular ATP concentration, which was suppressed by intracellular zinc chelation and inhibition of hemichannels. mRNA expression of several types of P2 receptors was detected in microglia, and periodate-oxidized ATP, a selective P2×7 receptor antagonist, attenuated the zinc-induced microglial activation via NADPH oxidase and PARP-1. Exogenous ATP and 2'(3')-O-(4-benzoyl-benzoyl) ATP also caused microglial activation through ROS generation and PAR formation. These findings demonstrate that ZIP1-mediated uptake of zinc induces ATP release and autocrine/paracrine activation of P2X(7) receptors, and then activates microglia, suggesting that zinc transporter-mediated uptake of zinc is a trigger for microglial activation via the NADPH oxidase and PARP-1 pathway. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc." ;

      dc:description "OBJECTIVE: 15(S)-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [15(S)-HETE] and 15(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid [15(S)-HPETE] are the products of arachidonic acid formed in the 15-lipoxygenase pathway. They have opposing effects on the inflammatory process. The present study was designed to examine the role of these metabolites on angiogenesis, which is critically associated with inflammatory conditions. METHODS: Chick chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM), rat aortic rings and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in culture were used to study the effect of 15(S)-HETE and 15(S)-HPETE on angiogenesis. Biochemical markers of angiogenesis were analysed by ELISA. RESULTS: 15(S)-HETE increased vessel density in chick CAM, induced sprouting in rat aortic rings and increased endothelial cell-cell contact and formation of tubular network-like structures in HUVECs. Furthermore, it up-regulated the expression of CD31, E-selectin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in HUVECs, indicating its pro-angiogenic effect. 15(S)-HPETE, on the other hand, decreased vessel density in chick CAM, down-regulated the expression of E-selectin (<35 %), VEGF (<90 %) and CD31 (<50 %) and did not produce sprouting in aortic rings, suggesting an anti-angiogenic property. 15(S)-HETE-mediated up-regulation of CD 31 and VEGF was reversed by treatment with 15(S)-HPETE. CONCLUSION: These results indicate the divergent effects of hydroxy and hydroperoxy products of 15-LOX on angiogenesis, highlighting the role of these products in the co-dependence of inflammation and angiogenesis." ;

      dc:description "The role of natural killer (NK) cells in infection-induced liver fibrosis remains obscure. In this study, we elucidated the effect of NK cells on Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) egg-induced liver fibrosis. Liver fibrosis was induced by infecting C57BL/6 mice with 18-20 cercariae of S. japonicum. Anti-ASGM1 antibody was used to deplete NK cells. Toll-like receptor 3 ligand, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) was used to enhance the activation of NK cells. Results showed that NK cells were accumulated and activated after S. japonicum infection, as evidenced by the elevation of CD69 expression and IFN-γ production. Depletion of NK cells markedly enhanced S. japonicum egg-induced liver fibrosis. Administration of poly I:C further activated NK cells to produce IFN-γ and attenuated S. japonicum egg-induced liver fibrosis. The observed protective effect of poly I:C on liver fibrosis was diminished through depletion of NK cells. Disruption of IFN-γ gene enhanced liver fibrosis and partially abolished the suppression of liver fibrosis by poly I:C. Moreover, expression of retinoic acid early inducible 1 (RAE 1), the NKG2D ligand, was detectable at high levels on activated hepatic stellate cells derived from S. japonicum-infected mice, which made them more susceptible to hepatic NK cell killing. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the activated NK cells in the liver after S. japonicum infection negatively regulate egg-induced liver fibrosis via producing IFN-γ, and killing activated stellate cells." ;

      dc:description "Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), a subset of dendritic cells characterized by a rapid and massive type-I interferon secretion through the Toll-like receptor pathway in response to viral infection, play important roles in the pathogenesis of several diseases, such as chronic viral infections (e.g., hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus), autoimmunity (e.g., psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus), and cancer. As pDC represent a rare cell type in the peripheral blood, the goal of this study was to develop a new method to efficiently generate large numbers of cells from a limited number of CD34(+) cord blood progenitors to provide a tool to resolve important questions about how pDC mediate tolerance, autoimmunity, and cancer. Human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells isolated from cord blood were cultured with a combination of Flt3-ligand (Flt3L), thrombopoietin (TPO), and one of the following cytokine: interleukin (IL)-3, interferon-β(IFN-β), or prostaglandin E2(PGE(2)). Cells obtained in the different culture conditions were analyzed for their phenotype and functional characteristics. The addition of IL-3 cooperates with Flt3L and TPO in the induction of pDC from CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells. Indeed, Flt3L/TPO alone or supplemented with prostaglandin E2 or interferon-β produced smaller amounts of pDC from hematopoietic progenitor cells. In addition, pDC generated in Flt3L/TPO/IL-3 cultures exhibited morphological, immunohistochemical, and functional features of peripheral blood pDC. We showed that IL-3, in association with Flt3L and TPO, provides an advantageous tool for large-scale generation of pDC. This culture condition generated, starting from 2 × 10(5) CD34(+) cells, up to 2.6 × 10(6) pDC presenting features of blood pDC." ;

Everything is carried out under GMP conditions according to SOPs.

In brief, patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma will undergo surgical resection of a melanotic lesion and leukapheresis will be performed on the following day. DCs will be generated from monocytes after elutriation of the leukapheresis product. On day 5 of culture immature DC will be pulsed with irradiated tumor cells (apoptotic bodies) prepared from the removed lesion and matured for 48 hours in presence of TNF-alpha.  Monocyte and DC viability as well as functionality will be continuously monitored. Such prepared DC will be used as DC vaccine, but also to expand T cells (isolated during the elutriation) for subsequent adoptive transfer. Before injection all cell products will be thoroughly tested to exclude contamination and presence of viable tumor cells. A portion of pulsed and unpulsed mature dendritic cells will be frozen and used to monitor immunological responses elicited by the DC vaccine and transferred T cells during the clinical trial. Treatment induced T cell responses will be evaluated by flow cytometry based methods (T cell phenotype, proliferation, perforin degranulation) and cytokine detection (Elispot, Elisa). The patients will be monitored for safety and toxicity of the treatment and for clinical response to immunotherapy.""" ;

      dc:description "Romidepsin is the second histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) approved for the treatment of advanced stages of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Recent in vitro data suggest that HDACis suppress immune function although these findings have not been confirmed in patients. Thus, we serially examined the cellular immune function of eight CTCL patients undergoing treatment with three cycles of romidepsin. We measured the patients' natural killer (NK) and dendritic cell (DC) function and performed an in vitro terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay to measure cellular apoptosis. Patients' NK cell cytolytic activity decreased from baseline to the third cycle of treatment (P = 0.018) but stimulation with a toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist increased this activity (P = 0.018). At baseline, a TLR agonist could both activate patients' DC (P = 0.043) and stimulate interleukin-12 protein production (P = 0.043) but both were suppressed after the first cycle of romidepsin. Finally, we observed increased specificity for romidepsin-induced CD4+ tumor cell apoptosis and dose-dependent increases in cellular apoptosis of healthy cells in multiple lineages (P < 0.05). These findings raise concern that HDACis suppress immune function in CTCL patients and they support the concurrent use of multiple immune stimulatory agents to preserve the host immune response. Am.

      dc:description "PURPOSE: To assess the role of gene-environment interaction between interleukin (IL)-4 promoter and mold exposure on the development of asthma. METHODS: We conducted a cohort-based, incident, case-control study. The case group consisted of 188 children with new asthma and the control group (n = 376) was matched for age and gender. The outcome of interest was the development of asthma over the 6-year study period. The studied determinants were three polymorphisms of IL-4 promoter (TT, CT, and CC) and three indicators of exposure including histories of water damage, presence of visible molds, and perceived mold odor in the home. RESULTS: Apparent joint effects between IL-4 promoter and mold exposure were observed on both additive and multiplicative scales. Specially, the risk of asthma was significantly associated with children carrying the CT genotype and visible mold exposure comparing with those carrying the TT genotype without any exposure indicator (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-4.34; modified Rothman synergy index for directly use of odds and OR [s] = 1.41; P for interaction = .03). A similar tendency was found (s = 1.30; P for interaction = .04) for children who were exposed to mold odor and carried CT genotype (adjusted OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.03-4.41). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that gene-environment interactions between the IL-4 promoter and an indoor mold problem may play an important role in childhood asthma." ;

      dc:description "Despite the existence of effective antiandrogen therapy for prostate cancer, the disease often progresses to castration-resistant states. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance for androgen deprivation in terms of the androgen receptor (AR)-regulated pathways is a requisite to manage castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Using a ChIP-cloning strategy, we identified functional AR binding sites (ARBS) in the genome of prostate cancer cells. We discovered that a centrosome- and microtubule-interacting gene, transforming acidic coiled-coil protein 2 (TACC2), is a novel androgen-regulated gene. We identified a functional AR-binding site (ARBS) including two canonical androgen response elements in the vicinity of TACC2 gene, in which activated hallmarks of histone modification were observed. Androgen-dependent TACC2 induction is regulated by AR, as confirmed by AR knockdown or its pharmacological inhibitor bicalutamide. Using long-term androgen-deprived cells as cellular models of CRPC, we demonstrated that TACC2 is highly expressed and contributes to hormone-refractory proliferation, as small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of TACC2 reduced cell growth and cell cycle progression. By contrast, in TACC2-overexpressing cells, an acceleration of the cell cycle was observed. In vivo tumor formation study of prostate cancer in castrated immunocompromised mice revealed that TACC2 is a tumor-promoting factor. Notably, the clinical significance of TACC2 was demonstrated by a correlation between high TACC2 expression and poor survival rates. Taken together with the critical roles of TACC2 in the cell cycle and the biology of prostate cancer, we infer that the molecule is a potential therapeutic target in CRPC as well as hormone-sensitive prostate cancer." ;

      dc:description "The standard current treatment options in advanced pancreatic cancer have demonstrated minimal or modest only efficacy for the majority of patients. Unfortunately, the mortality and morbidity remain high crying out for better treatments and results. With the exception of erlotinib, which received approval by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States in 2005, no other novel agents have since been added in our treatment quiver. Therefore, the search for novel approaches continuous at the laboratory and clinical level. At the 2012 American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Symposium, results of some interesting early phases clinical studies were presented. First, in Abstract #198, toxicity and efficacy results from the phase I/II study of cixutumumab, an insulin growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) antibody combined with the standard gemcitabine and erlotinib treatment were presented, but the outcomes suggest no real clinical benefit. Second, the early safety and clinical data from the novel monoclonal antibody (ensituximab) against the mucin epitope NPC-1C in pancreatic and colon cancer patients were presented (Abstract #233) and again no particular efficacy was observed. Finally, interesting results which definitely deserve further exploration were presented in Abstract #211, which tested the combination of ipilimumab, an antibody against the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), with a cell-based vaccine transfected with the granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene in advanced refractory pancreatic cancer. Though, it seems we have not yet found the culprit and the solution of this devastating disease, a small step forward might have been achieved." ;

      dc:description "Our knowledge regarding immune-protective and immunopathogenic events in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection is limited, and little is known about the dynamics of the immune response at the primary site of disease. Here, an African green monkey (AGM) model was used to elucidate immune mechanisms that facilitate viral clearance but may also contribute to persistent lung inflammation following SARS-CoV infection. During primary infection, SARS-CoV replicated in the AGM lung for up to 10 days. Interestingly, lung inflammation was more prevalent following viral clearance, as leukocyte numbers peaked at 14 days postinfection (dpi) and remained elevated at 28 dpi compared to those of mock-infected controls. Lung macrophages but not dendritic cells were rapidly activated, and both cell types had high activation marker expression at late infection time points. Lung proinflammatory cytokines were induced at 1 to 14 dpi, but most returned to baseline by 28 dpi except interleukin 12 (IL-12) and gamma interferon. In SARS-CoV homologous rechallenge studies, 11 of the 12 animals were free of replicating virus at day 5 after rechallenge. However, incidence and severity of lung inflammation was not reduced despite the limited viral replication upon rechallenge. Evaluating the role of antibodies in immune protection or potentiation revealed a progressive increase in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies in lung and serum that did not correlate temporally or spatially with enhanced viral replication. This study represents one of the first comprehensive analyses of lung immunity, including changes in leukocyte populations, lung-specific cytokines, and antibody responses following SARS-CoV rechallenge in AGMs." ;

      dc:description "BACKGROUND: A recent randomized placebo-controlled trial of the effect of atorvastatin treatment on the progression of newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes suggested a slower decline of residual beta cell function with statin treatment. Aim of this secondary analysis was to identify patient subgroups which differ in the decline of beta cell function during treatment with atorvastatin. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The randomized placebo-controlled Diabetes and Atorvastatin (DIATOR) Trial included 89 patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and detectable islet autoantibodies (mean age 30 years, 40% females), in 12 centers in Germany. Patients received placebo or 80 mg/d atorvastatin for 18 months. As primary outcome stimulated serum C-peptide levels were determined 90 min after a standardized liquid mixed meal. For this secondary analysis patients were stratified by single baseline characteristics which were considered to possibly be modified by atorvastatin treatment. Subgroups defined by age, sex or by baseline metabolic parameters like body mass index (BMI), total serum cholesterol or fasting C-peptide did not differ in C-peptide outcome after atorvastatin treatment. However, the subgroup defined by high (above median) baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations exhibited higher stimulated C-peptide secretion after statin treatment (p = 0.044). Individual baseline CRP levels correlated with C-peptide outcome in the statin group (r(2) = 0.3079, p<0.004). The subgroup with baseline CRP concentrations above median differed from the corresponding subgroup with lower CRP levels by higher median values of BMI, IL-6, IL-1RA, sICAM-1 and E-selectin. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Atorvastatin treatment may be effective in slowing the decline of beta cell function in a patient subgroup defined by above median levels of CRP and other inflammation associated immune mediators.

      rdfs:comment """We obtained data from studies of CD8 T cell properties in man comparing HIV, CMV and EBV-specific cells. 

It is usually assumed that effector gene expression in CD8 T cells may be similar in all immune responses, CD8 T cells in vivo differentiating into cytotoxic T cells that also produce g-inf. In contrast we published in 2007 that CD8 follow several differentiation waves and that effector gene expression is heterogeneous, different effector genes having different kinetics of expression-down regulation and associating randomly, suggesting that different immune responses could induce diverse differentiation patterns. 

In the present year: 
1° We studied the first differentiation wave, that occurs immediately after antigen stimulation, when cells able to induce inflammation are produced. We found a major expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines that is restricted to this period. We also developed an in vivo test where these effectors are transplanted in a matrigel, to study their capacity to attract other cell types. 

2° We initiated a vast comparison between CD8 T cells responding to very different stimuli. Our preliminary results show that CD8 T cells responding either to virus or Listeria have very different properties, indicating that the inflammatory context defines CD8 T cells with different properties.

CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were efficiently transfected with immunoreceptors specific for ErbB2 and CEA. The immunoreceptor expression was transient with half-maximal expression at day 2 and no detectable immunoreceptor expression at day 9 after electroporation. Immunoreceptor-transfected T cells were specifically activated upon coincubation with ErbB2(+) and CEA(+) tumor cells, respectively, resulting in secretion of interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha). Furthermore, immunoreceptor-transfected CD8(+) T cells specifically lysed ErbB2(+) and CEA(+) tumor cells, respectively. The RNA-transfected T cells retained their cytotoxic function after 2 days of activation and exhibited cytolytic activities like retrovirally transduced T cells. Opposed to  standard procedures using retroviral gene transduction to constitutively express immunoreceptors in T cells, transient immunoreceptor expression by RNA transfection should minimize the risk of persistence of potential autoaggression.""" ;

      dc:description "Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) mediates antiviral response by recognizing double-stranded RNA. Its cytoplasmic domain is tyrosine phosphorylated upon ligand binding and initiates downstream signaling via the adapter TIR-containing adaptor inducing interferon-β (TRIF). However, the kinase responsible for TLR3 phosphorylation remains unknown. We show here that Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK)-deficient macrophages failed to secrete inflammatory cytokines and IFN-β upon TLR3 stimulation and were impaired in clearing intracellular dengue virus infection. Mutant mice were also less susceptible to D-galactosamine/p(I:C)-induced sepsis. In the absence of BTK, TLR3-induced phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT and MAPK signaling and activation of NFκB, IRF3, and AP-1 transcription factors were all defective. We demonstrate that BTK directly phosphorylates TLR3 and in particular the critical Tyr759 residue. BTK point mutations that abrogate or led to constitutive kinase activity have opposite effects on TLR3 phosphorylation. Loss of BTK also compromises the formation of the downstream TRIF/receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1)/TBK1 complex. Thus, BTK plays a critical role in initiating TLR3 signaling." ;

In this Phase I trial using peptide-pulsed Dex, the observation of clinical regressions in the absence of T cell responses prompted the search for alternate effector mechanisms. Mouse studies unraveled the bioactivity of Dex onto NK cells, Dex promoting a IL-15Ra-dependent NK cell proliferation and a NKG2D-dependent activation resulting in an anti-metastatic effect. In humans, Dex bear functional IL-15R? which allow proliferation and IFNg secretion by NK cells. In contrast to immature DC, human Dex harbor NKG2D ligands on their surface leading to a direct engagement of NKG2D and NK cell activation ex vivo. In our phase I clinical trial, we highlight the capacity of Dex based-vaccines to restore the number and NKG2D-dependent function of NK cells in 7/14 patients. In conclusion, these data provide a mechanistic explanation on how Dex may stimulate non MHC restricted-anti-tumor effectors. Therefore, NK cell activation represents a new bioactivity for Dex leading to tumor recognition and regression in vivo.""" ;

      dc:description "The continued spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis poses a major threat to global tuberculosis control. Treatment is complex and requires longer use of more-expensive, less effective, and toxic anti-tuberculosis drugs, which results in high morbidity and mortality. The poor treatment outcomes and the slow progress in the development and evaluation of new tuberculosis drugs have given rise to the development of adjunct immunotherapy. The host immune system is a critical factor both for containment and cure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Augmentation or dampening of proinflammatory responses can be of value in the treatment of individuals who have nonproductive M. tuberculosis infection with inflammation-induced tissue damage. The use of immunotherapy with interleukin 2, interferon γ, and interleukin 7 as an adjunct to drug treatment may improve success rates for treatment of MDR tuberculosis, shorten treatment time for drug-sensitive tuberculosis, and improve the immunity of individuals by enhancing M. tuberculosis elimination to prevent recurrence of disease. A broad range of immunological treatments, including cytokine treatment or cell-based therapy, is now available, although not all have been evaluated in humans. This review gives a critical overview of current adjunct immunotherapies for active tuberculosis, which are at various stages of development." ;

DC produced conspicuous amounts of PTX3 when stimulated with LPS and this production is further increased in the presence of IL-10. However, PTX3 production was not increased in other alternative conditions of activation, such as in the presence of dexamethasone or calcitriol. PTX3 has properties similar to antibodies. Its production is induced by pathogen recognition, it recognizes microbial moieties, activates complement and facilitates recognition by phagocytes. Thus, this long pentraxin behaves as a bona fide ante-antibody." ;

      dc:description "Hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma account for 95% of primary liver cancer. For each of these malignancies, the outcome is dismal; incidence is rapidly increasing, and mechanistic understanding is limited. We observed abnormal proliferation of both biliary epithelium and hepatocytes in mice after genetic manipulation of Yes-associated protein, a transcription coactivator. Here, we comprehensively documented Yes-associated protein expression in the human liver and primary liver cancers. We showed that nuclear Yes-associated protein expression is significantly increased in human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. We found that increased Yes-associated protein levels in hepatocellular carcinoma are due to multiple mechanisms including gene amplification and transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. Survivin, a member of the inhibitors-of-apoptosis protein family, has been reported as an independent prognostic factor for poor survival in both hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. We found that nuclear Yes-associated protein expression correlates significantly with nuclear Survivin expression for both intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, using mice engineered to conditionally overexpress Yes-associated protein in the liver, we found that Survivin messenger RNA expression depends upon Yes-associated protein levels. Our findings suggested that Yes-associated protein contributes to primary liver tumorigenesis and likely mediates its oncogenic effects through modulating Survivin expression." ;

There is an increasing body of evidence attesting to epigenetic modifications that influence the development of distinct innate and adaptive immune response cells. Chromatin remodelling via acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination of histone proteins as well as DNA, methylation is epigenetic mechanisms by which immune gene expression can be controlled. In this paper, we will discuss the role of epigenetics in the regulation of host immunity, with particular emphasis on histone deacetylase inhibitors. In particular, the role of HDAC inhibitors as a new class of immunomodulatory therapeutics will also be reviewed." ;

      dc:description "The clinical application of chemotherapy to brain tumors has been severely limited because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) often prevents therapeutic levels from being achieved. Here we show that pulsed HIFU and human atherosclerotic plaque-specific peptide-1 (AP-1)-conjugated liposomes containing doxorubicin (AP-1 Lipo-Dox) act synergistically in an experimental brain tumor model. We developed an intracranial brain-tumor model in NOD-scid mice using human brain glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) 8401 cells. Pulsed HIFU was used to transcranially disrupt the BBB in these mouse brains by delivering ultrasound waves in the presence of microbubbles. Prior to each sonication, AP-1 Lipo-Dox or unconjugated Lipo-Dox was administered intravenously, and the concentration in the brains was quantified by fluorometer. Compared to control animals treated with injections of AP-1 Lipo-Dox or unconjugated Lipo-Dox, animals receiving the drug followed by pulsed HIFU exhibited enhanced accumulation of the drug in tumor cells. Drug injection with sonication increased the tumor-to-normal brain doxorubicin ratio of the target tumors by about twofold compared with the control tumors. Moreover, the tumor-to-normal brain ratio was highest after the injection of AP-1 Lipo-Dox with sonication. Combining sonication with AP-1 Lipo-Dox also significantly inhibited tumor growth compared with chemotherapy alone. There was a modest but significant increase in the median survival time in mice treated with AP-1 Lipo-Dox followed by pulsed HIFU, compared to those treated with AP-1 Lipo-Dox without sonication. The use of AP-1-conjugated liposomes carrying cytotoxic agents followed by pulsed HIFU represents a feasible approach for enhanced targeted drug delivery in brain tumor therapies." ;

Anemia is a frequent problem in hospitalized geriatric patients, and the anemia of chronic disease (ACD) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are the 2 most prevalent causes. The aim of the study was to assess the possible role of serum hepcidin in the differential diagnosis between ACD and IDA. Methods. We investigated serum hepcidin, iron status, anemia, and C-reactive protein in 39 consecutive geriatric patients with ACD and IDA. Serum hepcidin levels were determined using a commercial ELISA kit (DRG Instruments, Marburg, Germany). We also measured hepcidin in 26 healthy controls. Results. The serum hepcidin levels were not significantly higher in the 28 patients with ACD as compared to the 11 patients with IDA. Conclusions. The serum hepcidin levels measured using the commercial ELISA kit (DRG) do not appear to increase in older patients with ACD. It should be noted that an assay-specific problem could explain our results." ;

Patients and Methods: All EUS-FNA of solid pancreatic masses performed with a 22-gauge needle were included. Data on clinical presentations, mass characteristics, presence of pancreatitis, yield of tissue, and final diagnosis were compared between the two groups. On site cytopathology was provided and additional passes were requested to perform immunostains. Results : Two hundred and twenty-nine cases with either adenocarcinoma or USPM were included. The median age of the cohort was 65 years. ACP (210/229, 92%) accounted for the majority of the cases. The USPM included neuroendocrine (NET) masses (n=13), metastatic renal carcinoma (n=3), metastatic melanoma (n=1), lymphoma (n=1), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (n=1). Subjects with ACP were significantly more likely to present with loss of weight (P=0.02) or obstructive jaundice (P<0.001). Subjects with ACP were more likely to have suspicious/atypical FNA biopsy results as compared with USPM (10% vs 0%). The sensitivity of EUS-FNA with immunostains was 93% in ACP as compared with 100% in USPM. Diagnostic accuracy was higher in USPM as compared with ACP (100% vs 93%). Conclusions: EUS-FNA using a 22-gauge needle with immunostains has excellent diagnostic yield in patients with USPMs, which is comparable if not superior to the yield in pancreatic adenocarcinoma." ;

      rdfs:comment """The University of Florence can trace its origins to the Studium Generale, which was established by the Florentine Republic in 1321. Initially, Civil and Canon Law, Literature, and Medicine were among the subjects taught at the Studium, and various famous scholars were invited to teach there: Giovanni Bocaccio was asked to lecture on the Divine Comedy. 

However, the importance of the Studium was fully recognized with a Bull by Popo Clemente VI in 1349, in which he officially authorised the Studium to grant regular degrees, extended the Privilegia maxima, and established that the first Italian Faculty of Theology would be in Florence. 

In 1364, with Emperor Carlo VII, the Florentine Studium became an Imperial University. However, when Lorenzo the Magnificent gained control of Florence and much of Tuscany, the Studium was moved to Pisa, in 1473. Carlo VIII moved it back to Florence from 1497-1515, but with the return of the Medici family it was once again transferred to Pisa. 

In spite of these moves, many teaching activities continued in Florence, and scientific research found substantial support in the various Academies of the time, like the Crusca and the Cimento. 

Only in 1859, when the Grand Duke was exiled, were all these separate teaching activities reunited in a suitable system called the Istituto di Studi Pratici e di Perfezionamento; a year later this was recognized as a full fledged university by the Government of Unified Italy. 

In 1923, with a special Act of Parliament the Instututo was officially denominated a University. Later, the new University was organized into the various faculties: Agriculture, Architecture, Arts, Economics, Education, Law, Mathematics, Physical and Natural Sciences, Medicine and Surgery, Pharmacy, and Political Science. The Faculty of Engineering was added to the 10 faculties in 1970 and the Faculty of Psychology in 2002.""" ;

      dc:description "Background. Autophagy inhibits survival of intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis when induced by rapamycin or interferon γ (IFN-γ), but it remains unclear whether M. tuberculosis itself can induce autophagy and whether T cells play a role in M. tuberculosis-mediated autophagy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of M. tuberculosis on autophagy in human primary macrophages and the role of specific T cells in this process.Methods. M. tuberculosis (H37Rv)-infected macrophages were incubated with naive or M. tuberculosis-specific T cells. Autophagy was evaluated at 4 hours and 8 hours after infection by analyzing the levels of LC3-II (a hallmark of autophagy) and p62 (a protein degraded by autophagy). M. tuberculosis survival was evaluated by counting the colony-forming units.Results. M. tuberculosis infection of macrophages inhibited the autophagic process at 8 hours after infection. Naive T cells could not rescue this block, whereas M. tuberculosis-specific T cells restored autophagy degradation, accompanied by enhanced bacterial killing. Notably, the effect of M. tuberculosis-specific T cells was not affected by neutralization of endogenous IFN-γ and tumor necrosis factor α and was blocked by preventing contact between macrophages and T cells, suggesting that cell-cell interaction is crucial.Conclusions. M. tuberculosis inhibits autophagy in human primary macrophages, and specific T cells can restore functional autophagic flux through cell-cell contact." ;

      dc:description "Activated protein C (aPC) is a natural anticoagulant with strong cyto-protective and anti-inflammatory properties. aPC inhibits pancreatic inflammation and preserves functional islets after intraportal transplantation in mice. Whether aPC prevents the onset or development of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is unknown. In this study, when human recombinant aPC was delivered intraperitoneally, twice weekly for 10 weeks (from week 6 to 15) to non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a model for T1D, incidence of diabetes was reduced from 70% (Saline control) to 7.6% by age 26 weeks. Islets of aPC-treated mice exhibited markedly increased expression of insulin, aPC/protein C, endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 when examined by immunostaining. The insulitis score in aPC-treated mice was 50% less than that in control mice. T regulatory cells (Tregs) in the spleen, pancreatic islet and pancreatic lymph nodes were increased 37%, 53% and 59%, respectively, in NOD mice following aPC treatment. These Tregs had potent suppressor function and, after adoptive transfer, delayed diabetes onset in NOD.severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Culture of NOD mouse spleen cells with aPC reduced the secretion of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and interferon-gamma but increased IL-2 and transforming growth factor-β1, two cytokines required for Treg differentiation. In summary, our results indicate that aPC prevents T1D in the NOD mouse. aPC's mechanism of action is complex involving induction of Treg differentiation, inhibition of inflammation and possibly direct cyto-protective effects on β cells." ;

      dc:description "We find that a single respiratory administration of replicationally inactivated influenza A viral particles most often elicits a waning serum antibody response, as the long-sustained bone marrow antiviral plasma cell populations characteristically induced by viral infection are lacking, though antiviral plasma cells at other sites may occasionally persist for a long time. To determine whether this alteration in the pattern of the B-cell response is a reflection of the nature of T-helper (Th) priming, we simultaneously primed B cells with inactivated influenza A/PR8(H1N1) and Th cells with infectious A/x31(H3N2). We show that Th cells cross-react extensively between these two viruses, although the antibody response to viral envelope glycoproteins is completely non-cross-reactive. Th cells primed by infectious A/x31 have little impact on the antibody response specifically elicted from naïve B cells by inactivated A/PR8 viruses, suggesting that the characteristic vigour of the antibody response to influenza viral infection depends on the direct interaction of antiviral B cells with virally infected dendritic cells. Memory B cells primed by inactivated influenza viral particles however, respond rapidly to secondary challenge with live or inactivated viruses, promptly populating bone marrow with antiviral plasma cells. Moreover, Th cells primed by previous live A/x31 viral challenge alter the pattern of the response of naïve B cells to live A/PR8 challenge by accelerating the appearance of anti-H1/N1 plasma cells in bone marrow, eliminating the early spike of anti-H1/N1 plasma cells in the mediastinal node, and generally diminishing the magnitude of the lymph node response. Inactivated A/PR8 and infectious A/x31 are both effective vaccines against A/PR8 infection, as mice preimmunized with either vaccine exhibit much more rapid viral clearance from the lung after infectious A/PR8 challenge. In fact, even when given during a course of anti-CD8 treatment to preempt cross-reactive cytotoxic T cells, live A/x31 is a more effective vaccine against A/PR8 infection than is inactivated A/PR8 itself." ;

      dc:description "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Small airway narrowing is an important pathology which impacts lung function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The accumulation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts contribute to inflammation, remodeling and fibrosis by production and release of mediators such as cytokines, profibrotic factors and extracellular matrix proteins. This study investigated the effects of the phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor roflumilast, combined with the long acting beta2 adrenergic agonist indacaterol, both approved therapeutics for COPD, on fibroblast functions that contribute to inflammation and airway fibrosis. METHODS: The effects of roflumilast and indacaterol treatment were characterized on transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1)-treated normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLF). NHLF were evaluated for expression of the profibrotic mediators endothelin-1 (ET-1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), expression of the myofibroblast marker alpha smooth muscle actin, and fibronectin (FN) secretion. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was used to induce secretion of chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 10 (CXCL10), chemokine C-C motif ligand 5 (CCL5) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) from NHLF and drug inhibition was assessed. RESULTS: Evaluation of roflumilast (1-10 uM) showed no significant inhibition alone on TGFbeta1-induced ET-1 and CTGF mRNA transcripts, ET-1 and FN protein production, alpha smooth muscle expression, or TNF-alpha-induced secretion of CXCL10, CCL5 and GM-CSF. A concentration-dependent inhibition of ET-1 and CTGF was shown with indacaterol treatment, and a submaximal concentration was chosen for combination studies. When indacaterol (0.1 nM) was added to roflumilast, significant inhibition was seen on all inflammatory and fibrotic mediators evaluated, which was superior to the inhibition seen with either drug alone. Roflumilast plus indacaterol combination treatment resulted in significantly elevated phosphorylation of the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), an effect that was protein kinase A-dependent. Inhibition of protein kinase A was also found to reverse the inhibition of indacaterol and roflumilast on CTGF. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that addition of roflumilast to a LABA inhibits primary fibroblast/myofibroblast function and therapeutically this may impact lung fibroblast proinflammatory and profibrotic mediator release which contributes to small airway remodeling and airway obstruction in COPD." ;

      dc:description "The author hypothesized that multiple sclerosis (MS) is a humoral autoimmune disease, caused by faulty interplay between myelin-specific, dimeric IgE, specifically competing non-IgE antibodies and IgE-triggered degranulating mast cells. The principal fault was believed to be insufficient quantity of protective, specific non-IgE antibodies. Also conjectured was the possibility of an unexpected and adverse immune suppression caused by none-MS pharmaceuticals being consumed by patients for their MS or for other conditions. To test both hypotheses, a mimotopic, peptide antigen-based, serum immunoassay was developed to measure dimer-bound IgE excess among MS patients, wherein the IgE specifically complexes with two or more myelin surface epitopes at an interval of 40-100 Angstroms, a separation critical for mast cell degranulation and cell damaging effect. MS test sensitivity and specificity, when analyzing five previously untreated patients for dimeric IgE presence, was 100%. In direct comparison, twenty age- and gender-matched female and male control subjects were test negative. Analysis of 35 multiple sclerosis patients, who were concomitantly being treated with potentially immunosuppressive pharmaceuticals, appeared to show the substances' negative effect upon MS causation, progression, or specific immunoassay performance. Therefore, MS is likely an autoimmune disease caused by IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation possibly in conjunction with immunosuppressive agents." ;

      rdfs:comment """Our laboratory obtained data from studies of DC phagosomes and cross-presentation using K/O and mutant mouse strains. Cross presentation is the process by which Dendritic cells (DC) phagocytose pathogens or dying cell fragments, and present proteolytic peptides derived from these antigens in association with MHC class I molecules. The reasons why DCs are the only antigen presenting cells that efficiently cross present antigens are not well understood. 

We have demonstrated that the NADPH oxidase NOX2 is recruited to DC early phagosomes mediating a sustained production of low levels of reactive oxygen species and causing a maintained alkalynization of the phagosomal lumen. DCs lacking NOX2 show increased antigen degradation due to an enhanced phagosome acidification. As a result, the efficiency of in vitro and in vivo antigen cross presentation is significantly reduced in NOX2-deficient DCs. We also show that DCs derived from ashen mice, which are defective for the small GTPase Rab27a, fail to cross present antigens efficiently, due to increased phagosome acidification and antigen degradation. This defect in Rab27a-deficient DCs results from the impaired recruitment to phagosomes of the NOX2 membrane components. Therefore phagosomal alkalinization by NOX2 is controlled by Rab27a, and is required for efficient cross presentation in DCs.

In vivo, different subsets of DCs are considered with different competences to cross present antigens. The reasons why CD8+ DCs subset is the only one that efficiently carry out this phenomenon are not well understood. We have found that only CD8+ DCs display a NOX2 activity selectively localized to in phagosomes, causing alkalynization and preventing Ag degradation. In contrast, CD8- DCs, which exhibit higher total NOX2 activity than their counterparts but lack phagosomal ROS production, acidify their phagosomes causing more important antigen degradation which is unfavourable for cross presentation. Rac proteins are key components of NOX2 activation. Interestingly, we found that differential expression of Rac1 and Rac2 in the two DCs subsets, are responsible for the differential localization of ROS production in both cell types. """ ;

The Jozef Stefan Institute is the leading Slovenian scientific research institute, covering a broad spectrum of basic and applied research. The staff of more than 850 specializes in natural sciences, life sciences and engineering. The subjects concern production and control technologies, communication and computer technologies, knowledge technologies, biotechnologies, new materials, environmental technologies, nanotechnologies, and nuclear engineering. The mission of the Jozef Stefan Institute is the accumulation and dissemination of knowledge at the frontiers of natural science and technology to the benefit of society at large through the pursuit of education, learning, research, and development of high technology at the highest international levels of excellence. The Institute was founded in 1949. Initially established as an institute for Physics within the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, it is today involved in a wide variety of fields of both scientific and economic interest. After close to 60 years of scientific achievement, the Institute has become part of the image of Slovenia. The basic goals of the Institute are to provide expert scientific and applied output in the form of processes, products and consultancy, and to produce well-trained young scientists. The underlying philosophy is that these objectives can be achieved only if based on international class scientific research. With this in mind, the in-house research has been reinforced by building strong links to universities, other research institutions and industry. The Institute is closely connected with the Slovenian universities, where many scientists who initially developed their research talents at the Institute have been appointed to teaching posts, while still retaining their research positions or research teams at the Institute. Since 1985 more than 800 postgraduate students have gained their Ph.D. degrees at the Institute. Close collaboration with the Slovenian University Medical Centre has resulted in the development of medical equipment (tomography, electrical stimulators and appliances), the provision of isotopes for clinical research and treatment of patients, and the introduction of new research techniques and diagnostic methods into clinical medicine. The Institute devotes a considerable amount of effort to transferring the results of its research and knowledge to productive applications and to the market. 

ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR AND STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY 

Research areas:
- Protein biochemistry 
- Proteolysis and its regulation by inhibitors 
- Programmed cell death 
- Regulation of immune response 
- Protein folding and aggregation 
- Structural biology 
- Physiological and pathophysiological role of proteases in cancer, inflammation and neurodegenerative disorders 
- Proteomics 
- Chemical genomics 
- Nanobiology 
- Development of computational methods for structural biology 
- Biotechnological methods for production of recombinant proteins and antibodies 

The major goals of our research are to characterize the individual proteases (primarily from the cathepsin family) and their inhibitors (stefins, cystatins and related proteins) and to unravel the molecular mechanisms of processes leading to programmed cell death or regulating the immune response of the organism. In addition, our research is focused towards understanding the roles of proteases in various pathological processes, such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, and different neurological disorders (Huntington disease, …). An important area of research is also formation of amyloid fibers. For a better understanding of these processes a number of tools are needed, and therefore we are developing production of various antibodies and recombinant proteins (proteases and their inhibitors). We also participate in the development of activity-based probes for proteases suitable for work in cellular and in vivo models, and for testing pharmacologically-relevant compounds. In addition, we have a key role in establishing a center for proteomic research, which would cover the needs of whole Slovenia. One of the important areas is also understanding of the 3-D structures of biological macromolecules and their complexes at the atomic level, thereby linking the sequencing information with the mechanism of molecule action. In this way, the research is focused in target identification and validation, which are key areas of research in the field of biomedicine in connection with biotechnology. """ ;

      dc:description "T-cell activation involves multiple signaling pathways. In this report, we conducted in vitro and in vivo immune function analysis of tumor-draining lymph node (TDLN) cells after anti-CD3/anti-CD28 activation versus anti-CD3 activation alone in a murine tumor model. In cytokine release assays, the doubly activated TDLN cells secreted significantly greater amounts of IFN-gamma and GM-CSF in response to specific tumor antigen compared with anti-CD3 activated cells. In adoptive immunotherapy, the doubly activated TDLN cells were more effective in mediating regression of 3-day pulmonary metastases compared with anti-CD3 activated cells. Although there was predominant proliferation of CD8+ cells after either activation procedure, the mean-fold expansion of CD4+ cells was significantly greater after anti-CD3/anti-CD28 activation than anti-CD3 activation alone. Using magnetic bead-enriched T-cell subsets, we found that either CD4+ or CD8+ doubly activated TDLN cells could independently mediate tumor regression. Furthermore, the doubly activated CD4+ cells were more effective than CD8+ cells in adoptive immunotherapy on a per-cell basis. The antitumor activity mediated by CD4+ or CD8+ cells could be significantly enhanced with the exogenous administration of IL-2. CD28 co-stimulation of tumor-primed lymphoid cells promotes the generation of potent tumor reactive effector cells, particularly CD4+ T cells, with antitumor activity in adoptive immunotherapy." ;

      dc:description "RATIONALE: Addiction is a disease of learning and memory, as learning processes underlying acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement of drug-paired associations play central roles in addiction. Early developmental stress enhances risk for drug problems in adulthood. Environmental factors influencing learning and memory processes relevant to addiction remain incompletely characterized. OBJECTIVES: To determine effects of prenatal immune activation and developmental stress on conditioned place preference to amphetamine, and reversal learning. METHODS: Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) or vehicle on gestational day 14. Half of the male offspring received 2 h of restraint stress at post-natal day 35. Behavioral testing was performed in adulthood. RESULTS: Restraint stress inhibited acquisition of place preference to low-dose amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg), while poly I:C treatment had no measurable effect on place preference acquisition. In contrast, drug-induced reinstatement of preference for drug-paired chamber was enhanced in offspring of poly I:C-treated dams [F(1,25) = 5.31, p = 0.03]. Performance on a Morris water maze reversal learning task was impaired in poly I:C offspring. Reversal learning performance was correlated with place preference reinstatement in non-stressed (r (2) = 0.42, p = 0.0095), but not stressed rats (r (2) =0.04, p = 0.49). CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal immune activation enhances drug-induced reinstatement of conditioned place preference. These data demonstrate longstanding impact on behaviors with potential influence on risk for drug relapse as a consequence of prenatal immune activation. Further study is needed to determine clinical and epidemiological consequences of similar exposures in human populations." ;

Noted for its wide-ranging exploration of the sciences and technology, the Institute gathers together 2,500 scientists, technicians and research students devoted to adventuring into the unknown. In their labs, located in a landscaped campus environment, they share a vision: To better understand nature and our place within it. Inquisitiveness is their predominant trait. It is this curiosity that propelled Homo sapiens up the slope of evolution. It is this driving curiosity that sees man -- and woman -- through their greatest discoveries. It is the force which pushed earliest civilization to develop agriculture, to learn the hows of constructing shelter, to create the written word, to harness electricity to the wagon of industry and commerce, to contemplate far-off galaxies, to find the cure for disease, to form new materials, and to decipher the genetic code stamped on all living things, be they plant or animal. The desire to continue in this forward stride is the force behind every Institute scientist's efforts to penetrate realms formerly incomprehensible to humankind. And what dwells in these domains? The unknown. The only certainty: revelation encountered along their path. We invite you along to view a selection of landmark discoveries established by Weizmann scientists on a number of their scientific excursions.

      dc:description "Based on the hypothesis that consistent hyperglycemia can result in insulin resistance, we explored the induction of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) using diet of high glycemic/low fat index and compared the effects on the physiology and histology of the rats. The rats were divided into 3 groups. DM was induced in the first group by single intraperitoneal injection of 150mg/kg alloxan monohydrate and in the second group by feeding the rats with diet of high glycemic index/low fat for 8 weeks. The pathophysiology and histopathology of DM were studied. Hyperglycemia was recorded in the alloxan and food-induced groups respectively. Both groups were also positive for glycosuria, which confirmed the induction of DM. Concentrations of plasma potassium, calcium, protein and urea were higher (p<0.05) in the alloxan-induced than the food-induced diabetic rats, whereas food-induced rats recorded higher hematological indices than the alloxan-induced group. Coronary risk indices were higher in food-induced diabetic rats than the alloxan-induced, while activities of antioxidant enzymes were significantly higher (p<0.05) in alloxan-induced diabetic rats than the food-induced rats. Marked degenerations of the Islets of Langerhans was observed in pancreas of alloxan-induced diabetic rats, whereas, histological examination of the pancreas of food-induced and control rats revealed no visible lesion. Liver and kidney of all food and alloxan-induced diabetic rats showed marked degeneration of the hepatocytes and the glomeruli respectively. This study presents a rat model of type II diabetes mellitus using food of high glycemic/low fat index with its consequent ionoregulatory disruptions, acute anemia, hyperlipidemia, nephropathy and hepatopathy." ;

Unfortunately, the efficacy for such current therapy is limited, and newer approaches are sorely needed to treat this deadly disease. We have recently described the isolation of bacterial proteins and peptides with anticancer activity. In phase I human clinical trials, one such peptide, p28, derived from a bacterial protein azurin, showed partial and complete regression of tumors in several patients among 15 advanced-stage cancer patients with refractory metastatic tumors where the tumors were no longer responsive to current conventional drugs. An azurin-like protein called Laz derived from Neisseria meningitides demonstrates efficient entry and high cytotoxicity towards glioblastoma cells. Laz differs from azurin in having an additional 39-amino-acid peptide called an H.8 epitope, which allows entry and high cytotoxicity towards glioblastoma cells. Since p28 has been shown to have very little toxicity and high anti-tumor activity in advanced-stage cancer patients, it will be worthwhile to explore the use of H.8-p28, H.8-azurin, and Laz in toxicity studies and glioblastoma therapy in preclinical and human clinical trials." ;

The National Blood Service is not to be confused with the National Health Service.

We are an integral part of the NHS, and we guarantee to deliver blood, blood components, blood products and tissues from our 15 blood centres to anywhere in England and North Wales.

Naturally, we also ensure that the blood we supply is properly screened and is safe for patients. Every year we collect, test, process, store and issue 2.1 million blood donations. We depend entirely on voluntary donations from the general public, and try to encourage our existing donors to give three times a year. (It's amazing what the promise of a free cup of tea and some biscuits will do...)

But we also have a number of other functions. Such as continually carrying out new research into improving the safety of blood. And new ways it can be used to help save more lives.

We also provide specialist medical advice and clinical support to hospitals, as well as educating and training transfusion medicine specialists. It's a huge undertaking. But we're dedicated to keeping Britain's blood supply moving.

Our core purpose 
To save and improve patients' lives.

Our mission
We will deliver world-class services, building ever stronger partnerships with donors and the healthcare community

Our values 
We value people
• We listen and communicate clearly
• We strive to meet the needs of all our customers
• We recognise the achievements of others

We trust people
• To work to the highest possible standards of safety and quality
• To take responsibility for solving problems
• To embrace change for the better

We encourage people
• To be creative and innovative
• To work together to get things right
• To enjoy themselves and celebrate success.""" ;

      dc:description "Recombinant poxviruses (vaccinia and fowlpox) expressing tumor-associated antigens are currently being evaluated in clinical trials as cancer vaccines to induce tumor-specific immune responses that will improve clinical outcome. To test whether a diversified prime and boost regimen targeting NY-ESO-1 will result in clinical benefit, we conducted two parallel phase II clinical trials of recombinant vaccinia-NY-ESO-1 (rV-NY-ESO-1), followed by booster vaccinations with recombinant fowlpox-NY-ESO-1 (rF-NY-ESO-1) in 25 melanoma and 22 epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients with advanced disease who were at high risk for recurrence/progression. Integrated NY-ESO-1-specific antibody and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were induced in a high proportion of melanoma and EOC patients. In melanoma patients, objective response rate [complete and partial response (CR+PR)] was 14%, mixed response was 5%, and disease stabilization was 52%, amounting to a clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 72% in melanoma patients.

In EOC patients, the median PFS was 21 mo (95% CI, 16-29 mo), and median OS was 48 mo (CI, not estimable). CD8(+) T cells derived from vaccinated patients were shown to lyse NY-ESO-1-expressing tumor targets.

We have previously generated a monoclonal antibody, 2C44, that reacted to a peptide derived from the Leishmania LACK protein bound to I-Ad MHC class II molecules. We have successfully used the 2C44 mAb to visualize LACK-presenting DCs in mice infected with the L. major. In 2007, we have attempted to identify the APCs that are responsible for the development of immune tolerance in mice that have been breast-fed by antigen-exposed lactating mothers. Recent experiments performed in our laboratory have shown that the exposure of a mother to an airborne antigen during lactation impacts asthma development in their progeny. We found that airborne allergens were efficiently transferred from the mother to the neonate through the milk and that this transfer resulted in the development of antigen-specific tolerance. Breastfeeding-induced tolerance did not require the transfer of immunoglobulins, relied on the presence of TGF-beta during lactation and was mediated by regulatory CD4+ T lymphocytes. Adoptive transfer experiments of LACK-specific TCR transgenic T cells into newborn mice breastfed by LACK-exposed mothers demonstrated that LACK was readily processed and presented to T cells in the neonate.

We then investigated whether the immune status of the mother has an effect on the development of tolerance in the breast-fed mouse. We found that mice breastfed on allergen exposed allergic mothers were more resistant to allergic airway inflammation as compared to those breastfed on non allergic mothers. This phenomenon was demonstrated  to be dependent on the presence of allergen-specific Immunoglobulins (Ig) in the breastmilk of allergic mothers and on the transfer of immunecomplexes across the intestinal barrier of the newborn. In order to identify the APCs that were responsible for the development of this state of immune tolerance, we aimed to generate a transgenic mouse that express a recombinant fluorescent protein in the mammary glands, an approach that should result in high levels of expression of the fluorescent protein in the milk. We thus should be able to detect the cells that capture, degrade and present this antigen to T cells. Since we had previously generated a monoclonal antibody, 2C44, that reacts to a peptide derived from the Leishmania LACK protein bound to I-Ad MHC class II molecules, we chose to use LACK as a model antigen in these experiments. We have thus prepared two plasmids coding for LACK linked to either eGFP or mCherry fluorescent proteins, under the control of the beta-casein promoter. These constructs have been injected into fertilized eggs and transgenic animals are expected for march 2009. The characterization of antigen presenting cells will be performed using FACS analysis or confocal microscopy.""" ;

      dc:description "A20 is a zinc finger protein with ubiquitin-modifying activity. A20 has been described as negatively regulating signaling induced by the TNF receptor and TLR family in a number of cell types, including mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs). However, the expression and effect of A20 in activated human monocyte-derived DCs have not been previously evaluated. We report that DCs activated with the TLR3 ligand poly(I:C) up-regulate A20. Down-regulating A20 demonstrated its role in the functional activation of DCs. A20 down-regulated DCs showed higher activation of the transcription factors NF-kappaB and activator protein-1, which resulted in increased and sustained production of IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12p70. We additionally silenced the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 and demonstrated that IL-10 inhibits T cell proliferation. We further demonstrated that A20 down-regulated DCs skew naive CD4+ T cells toward IFN-gamma producing Th1 cells, a process which is dependent on IL-12p70 and which is unaffected by IL-10. Furthermore, A20 and/or IL-10 down-regulated DCs had an enhanced capacity to prime Melan-A/MART-1 specific CD8+ T cells. Finally, we demonstrated that potent T cell stimulatory DCs are generated by the simultaneous delivery of poly(I:C12U), A20, or A20/IL-10 small interfering RNA and Ag-encoding mRNA, introducing a one step approach to improve DC-based vaccines. Together these findings demonstrate that A20 negatively regulates NF-kappaB and activator protein-1 in DCs and that down-regulation of A20 results in DCs with enhanced T cell stimulatory capacity." ;

      dc:description "Adoptive cell therapy of metastatic melanoma with autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is clinically effective, but TIL production can be challenging. Here we describe a simplified method for initial TIL culture and rapid expansion in gas-permeable flasks. TIL were initially cultured from tumor digests and fragments in 40 mL capacity flasks with a 10 cm gas-permeable silicone bottom, G-Rex10. A TIL rapid expansion protocol (REP) was developed using 500 mL capacity flasks with a 100 cm gas-permeable silicone bottom, G-Rex100. TIL growth was successfully initiated in G-Rex10 flasks from tumor digests from 13 of 14 patients and from tumor fragments in all 11 tumor samples tested. TIL could then be expanded to 8-10×10 cells in a 2-step REP that began by seeding 5×10 TIL into a G-Rex100 flask, followed by expansion at day 7 into 3 G-Rex100 flasks. To obtain the 30-60×10 cells used for patient treatment, we seeded 6 G-Rex100 flasks with 5×10 cells and expanded into 18 G-Rex100 flasks. Large-scale TIL REP in gas-permeable flasks requires approximately 9-10 L of media, about 3-4 times less than other methods. In conclusion, TIL initiation and REP in gas-permeable G-Rex flasks require fewer total vessels, less media, less incubator space, and less labor than initiation and REP in 24-well plates, tissue culture flasks, and bags. TIL culture in G-Rex flasks will facilitate the production of TIL at the numbers required for patient treatment at most cell processing laboratories." ;

      rdfs:comment """My laboratory obtained data from a continued analysis of the ability of invariant NKT (iNKT) cells to assist priming of antigen specific T and B cell responses. We have carried out three complementary lines of research:

1) We have demonstrated that activation of human DC by Toll like receptor ligands (TLR-L) modulates the lipid biosynthetic pathway, resulting in enhanced recognition of CD1d-associated lipids by iNKT cells. 

2) We have clarified the mechanisms by which CD1d-restricted lymphocytes translate T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of lipids with similar group heads into distinct biological responses. Using a soluble iNKT TCR and a newly engineered antibody specific for alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer)-human CD1d (hCD1d) complexes, we measured the affinity of binding of iNKT TCR to hCD1d molecules loaded with a panel of alpha-GalCer analogues and assessed the rate of dissociation of alpha-GalCer and alpha-GalCer analogues from hCD1d molecules. We have extended this analysis by studying iNKT cell synapse formation and iNKT cell activation by the same panel of alpha-GalCer analogues. Our results indicate the unique role of the lipid chain occupying the hCD1d F' channel in modulating TCR binding affinity to hCD1d-lipid complexes, the formation of stable immunological synapse, and cell activation. Our results indicate a general mechanism by which lipid-specific lymphocytes are capable of recognizing both the group head and the length of lipid antigens, ensuring greater specificity of antigen recognition.

3) We demonstrated that pathogen-derived signals to DC mediated via TLRs can be modulated by activated iNKT cells 
(Hermans et al, 2007). DC maturation induced in vivo with any one of a variety of TLR ligands was greatly improved through simultaneous administration of the iNKT cell ligand alpha-galactosylceramide. DC isolated from animals treated simultaneously with TLR and iNKT cell ligands were potent stimulators of naive T cells in vitro compared with DC from animals treated with the ligands individually. Injection of protein Ags with both stimuli resulted in significantly improved T cell and Ab responses to coadministered protein Ags over TLR stimulation alone. Ag-specific CD8(+) T cell responses induced in the presence of the TLR4 ligand monophosphoryl lipid A and alpha-galactosylceramide showed faster proliferation kinetics, and increased effector function, than those induced with either ligand alone. Human DC exposed to TLR ligands and activated iNKT cells in vitro had enhanced expression of maturation markers, suggesting that a cooperative action of TLR ligands and iNKT cells on DC function is a generalizable phenomenon across species. 

These studies highlight the potential for manipulating the interactions between TLR ligands and iNKT cell activation in the design of effective vaccine adjuvants. """ ;

      dc:description "We investigated the role of Th1 ad Th2 cytokines in rejection and tolerance using the neonatal tolerance model. We reported previously that lymph nodes that drained immunogen-bearing tolerant grafts produced a 10- to 100-fold higher ratio of interleukin (IL)-4 to interferon (IFN)-gamma compared with lymph node cells from rejected grafts. Moreover, because neonatal antigen exposure triggers allospecific Th2 CD4 memory cells, whereas antigen exposure during adulthood triggers Th1 CD4 memory cells, we speculated that immunoredirection toward Th2 and away from Th1 functions as another mechanism of tolerance. To test the immunoredirection hypothesis, we examined whether recovery of Th1 cytokine responses abrogates tolerance. We now show that treatment with exogenous IFN-gamma at the time of neonatal priming recovered mixed lymphocyte reaction hypoproliferation and restored the ability of mice to reject skin grafts. Mice that received IFN-gamma at the time of neonatal priming produced more IFN-gamma and contained more A/J-reactive IFN-gamma producing CD4 cells compared with untreated neonatal primed mice, but failed to recover A/J-specific INF-gamma-producing CD8 cells or CTL responses, which suggests that graft rejection occurred via Th1 CD4 cells. Interestingly, draining lymph node cells from rejected grafts in IFN-gamma-treated neonatal primed mice also produced more IL-4, compared with cells from healthy grafts on untreated neonatal primed mice. Nonetheless, lower IL-4 to IFN-gamma ratio predicted graft rejection and higher ratios predicted acceptance. We conclude that neonatal tolerance depends on the ability to block generation of allospecific Th1 responses that lead to rejection. Thus, immunoredirection involves both the inhibition of Th1 and expansion of Th2 immune responses." ;

      dc:description "Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) is a vision-threatening corneal infection that is intimately associated with contact lens use which leads to hypoxic conditions on the corneal surface. However, the effect of hypoxia on the Acanthamoeba-induced host inflammatory response of corneal epithelial cells has not been studied. In the present study, we investigated the effect of hypoxia on the Acanthamoeba-induced production of inflammatory mediators interleukin-8 (IL-8) and interferon-β (IFN-β) in human corneal epithelial cells and then evaluated its effects on the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling, including TLR4 and myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88) (MyD88) expression as well as the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2). We then studied the effect of hypoxia on a TLR4-specific inflammatory response triggered by the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our data showed that hypoxia significantly decreased the production of IL-8 and IFN-β. Furthermore, hypoxia attenuated Acanthamoeba-triggered TLR4 expression as well as the activation of NF-κB and ERK1/2, indicating that hypoxia abated Acanthamoeba-induced inflammatory responses by affecting TLR4 signaling. Hypoxia also inhibited LPS-induced IL-6 and IL-8 secretion, myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88) MyD88 expression and NF-κB activation, confirming that hypoxia suppressed the LPS-induced inflammatory response by affecting TLR4 signaling. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that hypoxia attenuated the host immune and inflammatory response against Acanthamoeba infection by suppressing TLR4 signaling, indicating that hypoxia might impair the host cell's ability to eliminate the Acanthamoeba invasion and that hypoxia could enhance cell susceptibility to Acanthamoeba infection. These results may explain why contact lens use is one of the most prominent risk factors for AK." ;

An immunohistochemical study of the biopsy specimen demonstrated that CD8+ T cells infiltrated into hair follicles with satellite cell necrosis of keratinocytes. Four weeks after his initial visit, he again had another traffic accident. Despite the treatment with oral prednisolone and a topical steroid, the alopecia became universalis. Treatment with systemic and topical steroids was continued, and 12 weeks later, white vellus hairs grew over the whole scalp. Intracytoplasmic study revealed that there was a positive correlation between the severity of the alopecia and the increase of interferon-gamma producing Th1 cells or interleukin (IL)-17 producing Th17 cells, whereas the number of IL-4 expressing Th2 cells was inversely proportional to the extent of alopecia. The autoimmune hair loss might occur via the activation of T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells." ;

Here we describe the generation and preclinical evaluation of 3 new recombinant ALVAC(2) poxviruses vCP2264, vCP2291, and vCP2292 for their ability to induce the desired cellular immune responses against the encoded melanoma-associated antigens. This was done either in HLA-A2/K transgenic mice or using in vitro antigen-presentation studies. These studies demonstrated that the vaccine was able to induce HLA-A*0201-restricted T-cell responses against gp100 and NY-ESO-1, detectable directly ex vivo, in HLA-A2/K-transgenic mice. The in vitro antigen presentation studies, in the absence of appropriate animal models, demonstrated that target cells infected with the vaccine construct were lysed by MAGE-1, MAGE-3 or MART-1 peptide-specific T cells. These data indicate that ALVAC(2)-encoded melanoma-associated antigens can be properly processed and presented to induce antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses. To enhance the immunogenicity of the melanoma antigens, a TRIad of COstimulatory Molecules (TRICOM) were also cloned into all 3 vectors. Increased in vitro proliferation and IFN-γ production was observed with all ALVAC(2) poxviruses encoding TRICOM, confirming the immune-enhancing effect of the ALVAC-encoded TRICOM. These studies demonstrated that all components of the vaccine were functionally active and provide a rationale for moving this candidate vaccine to the clinic." ;

      dc:description "The production of allergen-specific IgE antibodies (Abs) in allergen-sensitized patients or animals has a mutual relation with the immunologic response leading to allergic rhinitis. We recently reported that after an intranasal injection of cedar pollen into mice, an interleukin-4 (IL-4)-dependent increase in serum nonspecific IgE Ab was a prerequisite for the production of serum allergen-specific IgE Ab. Here, we explored which lymphoid organ was responsive to the intranasally injected allergen and how IL-4 and IgE Ab were produced in the lymphocytes. Time-dependent changes in the total cell numbers and in the in vitro IgE Ab production in various lymphoid organs revealed that the submandibular lymph nodes were the main responsible organ. After treatment with allergen (for IgE production) or allergen and complete Freund's adjuvant (for IgG production), we separated submandibular lymph node cells into macrophage-, lymphocyte-, and granulocyte-rich populations by discontinuous Percoll density-gradient centrifugation. Unexpectedly, bulk cells, but not the lymphocyte- or macrophage-rich population, produced significant amounts of IL-4, IgE, and IgG; whereas the production was restored by the addition of Mac-1(+) cells in the macrophage-rich fraction to the lymphocyte-rich fraction. Furthermore, the combination of the lymphocyte-rich population [for the IgG (or IgE) production] with the macrophage-rich population [for the IgE (or IgG) production] produced a large amount of IgE (or IgG). These results indicate that macrophages in the submandibular lymph nodes are essential not only for IL-4 or immunoglobulin production but also for the class switching of immunoglobulin in lymphocytes in the initiation of allergic rhinitis." ;

Clinically, this condition can resemble malignant melanoma and histologically, it has a lentiginous pattern with variable degrees of atypia and an absence of dermal nests. These features may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of lentigo maligna melanoma or lentiginous melanoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed 14 cases of atypical lentiginous nevus diagnosed at the dermatology department of Hospital General de Valencia in Valencia, Spain between December 2007 and March 2009. We studied the clinical and histopathologic features of the lesions after hematoxylin-eosin, Melan-A, and Ki-67 staining and compared our results to data reported in the literature. RESULTS: Four (28%) of the 14 patients (7 men, 7 women) were under 50 years of age. Clinically, most of the lesions (8/14) resembled atypical nevi and they were all located on the back. Histologically, they all had irregular lentiginous epidermal hyperplasia, with a proliferation of individual melanocytes only in the basal layer of the epidermis and an absence of dermal nests. Focal upward migration of melanocytes into the epidermis was present in just 4 cases. All the lesions had cellular atypia, which was moderate in 85% of cases. The Ki-67 proliferation index was low (<5%) in all the lesions analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical lentiginous nevi, which can be classified as atypical pigmented lesions with a lentiginous pattern, may clinically and histologically resemble melanoma. Our findings support earlier reports that both clinical and histologic findings may suggest a diagnosis of dysplastic nevus. All of the patients in our series are healthy and free of recurrence after 18 months or longer." ;

      dc:description "Research has confirmed that peptides and larger protein molecules pass through the mucosal barrier of the gastrointestinal tract. Orally administered serine and cysteine proteases of plant and animal origin also reach blood and lymph as intact, high molecular weight and physiologically active protein molecules. Their absorption may be supported by a self-enhanced paracellular transport mechanism resulting in sub-nanomolar concentration of transiently free protease molecules or, in a complex with anti-proteases, at higher concentrations. Data from pharmacokinetic investigations reveals dose linearity for maximum plasma levels of free proteases not unusual for body proteases and a high inter-individual variability. There is no interference with each other after oral administration of protease combinations, and absorption follows an unusual invasion and elimination kinetic due to slow velocity of absorption and a fast 100% protein binding to anti-proteases. Oral application of proteases leads to increased proteolytic serum activity and increased plasma concentrations of the corresponding anti-proteases. Their biological activity is determined by their proteolytic activity as free proteases on soluble peptides/proteins or cell surface receptors (e.g. protease activated receptors) and their activity in the complex formed with their specific and/or unspecific anti-proteases. The anti-protease-complexes, during immune reaction and injuries often loaded with different cytokines, are cleared from body fluids and tissue by receptor mediated endocytosis on hepatocytes and/or blood cells. Oral administration of enteric coated tablets containing proteolytic enzymes of plant and animal origin may be a safe method to stabilize, positively influence or enhance physiological and immunological processes during disease processes and in healthy consumers." ;

      rdfs:comment """The objective of the creation of the Institut de Transplantation et de Recherche en Transplantation (ITERT) was to promote a medical-biological dynamic entity capable of promoting transplantation medicine and its research to a level of European excellence. The ITERT was created in 1991 based on article L6.146-8 of the code of public health offering the possibility to experiment with new forms of medical organisation linking, for example, a clinical activity and a biological activity. 
The ITERT is located in the Jean Monnet building on the Hôtel-Dieu site of Nantes University Hospital where it occupies different floors including the basement (animal section), the garden level (consultations, secretariat, medical offices, conference room, DIVAT –database-and annex of Etablissement Français des Greffes (French Transplant Organisation), the upper ground floor (Nephrology and Clinical Immunology Department, including acute haemodialysis care unit and graft intensive care), and the first floor (INSERM UMR 643). Only the Large Animal Laboratory, for obvious technical reasons, is located in the Hôtel-Dieu away from Jean Monnet. The main part of the clinical and biological activity of the ITERT is therefore grouped together on one single site: the Jean Monnet building of the Hôtel-Dieu. 
The ITERT is one of the two leading European centres in the number of transplanted kidneys (175 in 2004). For the last three years, the ITERT is one of the two leading French centre for pancreas transplantation (31 in 2004). The length of the waiting list of patients for transplants at the ITERT is 427 for kidneys and 36 for the pancreas. 

Since 1991, the ITERT has published 440 scientific articles and 264 of them were original ones. 

The ITERT has an international scientific council and has been supported since its creation by the Fondation Progreffe, a charitable foundation of companies. 

The ITERT has contributed to the creation of three companies in the domain of biotechnology and healthcare databanks. 

The ITERT is part of a local biomedical institute of research (Institut Fédératif de Recherche 26) which gathers more of 650 scientific personnel. 

The ITERT has close links to OUEST-Génopole through their common facilities (rat transgenesis and transcriptome). A center for regenerative medicine (Centre d’Investigations Clinique en Biothérapie) has recently been created in Nantes University Hospital and the ITERT was one of the initiators of the proposal. The recently awarded Atlantic Biotherapies National Competitivity Pole encompasses academic and industrial partners in this area, including the ITERT (President, J-P. Soulillou).""" ;

In a large percentage of these patients, lower limb amputation is still required. Studies of ischaemic skeletal muscle disclosed evidence of endogenous angiogenesis and adaptive skeletal muscle metabolic changes in response to hypoxia. Chemokines are potent chemoattractant cytokines that regulate leukocyte trafficking in homeostatic and inflammatory processes. More than 50 different chemokines and 20 different chemokine receptors have been cloned. The chemokine stromal-cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1 aka CXCL12) is a constitutively expressed and inducible chemokine that regulates multiple physiological processes, including embryonic development and organ homeostasis. The biologic effects of SDF-1 are mediated by chemokine receptor CXCR4, a 352 amino acid rhodopsin-like transmembrane-specific G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). There is evidence that the administration of SDF-1 increases blood flow and perfusion via recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). This review will focus on the role of the SDF-1/CXCR4 system in the pathophysiology of PVD and discuss their potential as therapeutic targets for PVD." ;

Treatment of neonatal mice with recombinant IFNalpha has a short-term, FL-independent and a long-term, FL-dependent protective effect against HSV-1. In mice lacking FL, neonatal resistance against HSV-1 is very low and DC numbers in the spleen are reduced. The treatment of these mice with rIFNalpha at day 6 resulted in an increased resistance against infection with HSV-1 at day 7. In C57BL/6 mice, treatment with rIFNalpha at birth induced both FL and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) that resulted in enhanced resistance against HSV-1 at day 7. In contrast, in mice lacking FL, IFNalpha treatment at birth did not influence splenic cell composition and had no effect on viral protection. The transfer of pDC to mice lacking FL enhanced viral resistance." ;

      dc:description "Evidence for the in vitro lymphocyte response against autologous melanoma has been accumulating over the past 10 years, leading to the identification of numerous melanoma-associated antigens recognised by T cells. These antigens are targets for specific immunotherapy protocols. However, their expression is heterogeneous during tumour progression and may contribute to therapeutic escape mechanisms and disease progression. This study was designed to chart the importance of these escape mechanisms, and to assess the relationship between gene expression and the clinical profile (especially survival data) of patients with melanoma. We studied the expression of certain melanoma genes in tissue biopsies from 202 patients using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The evaluated genes were Melan-A, tyrosinase, Na-17A, MAGE-1, MAGE-3 and Ny-ESO-1. We then correlated the results to the patients' survival data. 202 samples (cutaneous, nodal and visceral biopsies) were analysed by RT-PCR. No relationship was found between clinical data and gene expression. No relationship was found between survival data and gene expression, when samples of all stages were combined in the analysis. However, interactions between gene expression and disease stage were significant. When stage III samples alone were considered, MAGE-3 expression alone or in association with the expression of the other tumour-specific genes was found to be significantly associated with a higher disease-free survival (respectively, P = 0.0349; 0.007). Our results provided no evidence for a relationship between gene expression and clinical data, or between gene expression and survival data. However, with regard to certain sub-groups, such as stage III samples, tumour gene expression was significantly associated with survival." ;

      dc:description "p53 is critical in the normal response to a variety of cellular stresses including DNA damage and loss of p53 function is a common feature of many cancers. In hematological malignancies, p53 deletion is less common than in solid malignancies but is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. Compared to their wild-type (WT) counterparts, hematopoietic progenitor cells lacking p53 have a greater propensity to survive cytokine loss, in part, due to the failure to transcribe Puma, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member. Using expression arrays, we have further characterized the differences that distinguish p53(-/-) cells from WT myeloid cells in the presence of Interleukin-3 (IL-3) to determine if such differences contribute to the increased clonogenicity and survival responses observed in p53(-/-) cells. We show that p53(-/-) cells have a deregulated intracellular signaling environment and display a more rapid and sustained response to IL-3. This was accompanied by an increase in active ERK1/2 and a dependence on an intact MAP kinase signaling pathway. Contrastingly, we find that p53(-/-) cells are independent on AKT for their survival. Thus, loss of p53 in myeloid cells results in an altered transcriptional and kinase signaling environment that favors enhanced cytokine signaling." ;

Treatment of neonatal mice with recombinant IFNalpha has a short-term, FL-independent and a long-term, FL-dependent protective effect against HSV-1. In mice lacking FL, neonatal resistance against HSV-1 is very low and DC numbers in the spleen are reduced. 

In C57BL/6 mice, treatment with rIFNalpha at birth induced both FL and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) that resulted in enhanced resistance against HSV-1 at day 7. In contrast, in mice lacking FL, IFNalpha treatment at birth did not influence splenic cell composition and had no effect on viral protection. The transfer of pDC to mice lacking FL enhanced viral resistance.""" ;

F. de Godoy (Post-doc) and Jesper V. Olsen (PhD student). Recently, our lab has been developing new techniques in quantitative proteomics and has also acquired new instrumentation to assess these types of questions in depth. This, of course, involves a lot of optimization and, consequently, large amounts of sample. However, to obtain high numbers of dendritic cells is not a trivial process, and can also be very expensive. For that reason, we have been using other model systems, like yeast, for all the general optimization steps, to have a basic set-up before we perform the experiments with the DCs." ;

      dc:description "Toxoplasma gondii penetrates all kinds of nucleated eukaryotic cells but modulates host cells differently for its intracellular survival. In a previous study, we found out that serine protease inhibitors B3 and B4 (SERPIN B3/B4 because of their very high homology) were significantly induced in THP-1-derived macrophages infected with T. gondii through activation of STAT6. In this study, to evaluate the effects of the induced SERPIN B3/B4 on the apoptosis of T. gondii-infected THP-1 cells, we designed and tested various small interfering (si-) RNAs of SERPIN B3 or B4 in staurosporine-induced apoptosis of THP-1 cells. Anti-apoptotic characteristics of THP-1 cells after infection with T. gondii disappeared when SERPIN B3/B4 were knock-downed with gene specific si-RNAs transfected into THP-1 cells as detected by the cleaved caspase 3, poly-ADP ribose polymerase and DNA fragmentation. This anti-apoptotic effect was confirmed in SERPIN B3/B4 overexpressed HeLa cells. We also investigated whether inhibition of STAT6 affects the function of SERPIN B3/B4, and vice versa. Inhibition of SERPIN B3/B4 did not influence STAT6 expression but SERPIN B3/B4 expression was inhibited by STAT6 si-RNA transfection, which confirmed that SERPIN B3/B4 was induced under the control of STAT6 activation. These results suggest that T. gondii induces SERPIN B3/B4 expression via STAT6 activation to inhibit the apoptosis of infected THP-1 cells for longer survival of the intracellular parasites themselves." ;

      dc:description "We adapted our mouse model of allergic contact hypersensitivity to nickel for the study of tolerance. Sensitization in this model is achieved by the administration of nickel ions with H(2)O(2); nickel ions alone are unable to prime naive T cells, but can restimulate primed ones. A 4-wk course of oral or i.p. administration of 10 mM NiCl(2) to naive mice induced tolerance, preventing the induction of hypersensitivity for at least 20 wk; long term desensitization of nickel-sensitized mice, however, required continuous NiCl(2) administration. When splenic T cells of orally tolerized donors, even after a treatment-free interval of 20 wk, were transferred to naive recipients, as with lymph node cells (LNC), they specifically prevented sensitization of the recipients. The LNC of such donors were anergic, because upon in vivo sensitization with NiCl(2) in H(2)O(2) and in vitro restimulation with NiCl(2), they failed to show the enhanced proliferation and IL-2 production as seen with LNC of mice not tolerized before sensitization. As few as 10(2) bulk T cells, consisting of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells, were able to specifically transfer tolerance to nickel. A hypothesis is provided to account for this extraordinarily high frequency of nickel-reactive, suppressive T cells; it takes into account that nickel ions fail to act as classical haptens, but form versatile, unstable metal-protein and metal-peptide complexes. Furthermore, a powerful amplification mechanism, such as infectious tolerance, must operate which allows but a few donor T cells to tolerize the recipient." ;

      dc:description "Small RNA regulatory pathways are used to control the activity of transposons, regulate gene expression and resist infecting viruses. We examined the biogenesis of mRNA-derived endogenous short-interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) in the disease vector mosquito Aedes aegypti. Under standard conditions, mRNA-derived endo-siRNAs were produced from the bidirectional transcription of tail-tail overlapping gene pairs. Upon infection with the alphavirus, Sindbis virus (SINV), another class of mRNA-derived endo-siRNAs was observed. Genes producing SINV-induced endo-siRNAs were not enriched for overlapping partners or nearby genes, but were enriched for transcripts with long 3' untranslated regions. Endo-siRNAs from this class derived uniformly from the entire length of the target transcript, and were found to regulate the transcript levels of the genes from which they were derived. Strand-specific quantitative PCR experiments demonstrated that antisense strands of targeted mRNA genes were produced to exonic, but not intronic regions. Finally, small RNAs mapped to both sense and antisense strands of exon-exon junctions, suggesting double-stranded RNA precursors to SINV-induced endo-siRNAs may be synthesized from mature mRNA templates. These results suggest additional complexity in small RNA pathways and gene regulation in the presence of an infecting virus in disease vector mosquitoes." ;

      dc:description "Abstract SmartDCs (Self-differentiated Myeloid-derived Antigen-presenting-cells Reactive against Tumors) consist of highly viable dendritic cells (DCs) induced to differentiate with lentiviral vectors (LVs) after an overnight ex vivo transduction. Tricistronic vectors co-expressing cytokines (granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor [GM-CSF], interleukin [IL]-4) and a melanoma antigen (tyrosine related protein 2 [TRP2]) were used to transduce mouse bone marrow cells or human monocytes. Sixteen hours after transduction, the cells were dispensed in aliquots and cryopreserved for identity, potency, and safety analyses. Thawed SmartDCs readily differentiated into highly viable cells with a DC immunophenotype. Prime/boost subcutaneous administration of 1×10(6) thawed murine SmartDCs into C57BL/6 mice resulted into TRP2-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses and protection against lethal melanoma challenge. Human SmartDC-TRP2 generated with monocytes obtained from melanoma patients secreted endogenous cytokines associated with DC activation and stimulated TRP2-specific autologous T-cell expansion in vitro. Thawed human SmartDCs injected subcutaneously in NOD.Rag1(-/-).IL2rγ(-/-) mice maintained DC characteristics and viability for 1 month in vivo and did not cause any signs of pathology. For development of good manufacturing practices, CD14(+) monocytes selected by magnetic-activated cell separation were transduced in a closed bag system (multiplicity of infection of 5), washed, and cryopreserved. Fifty percent of the monocytes used for transduction were recovered for cryopreservation. Thawed SmartDCs produced in two independent runs expressed the endogenous cytokines GM-CSF and IL-4, and the resulting homogeneous SmartDCs that self-differentiated in vitro contained approximately 1.5-3.0 copies of integrated LVs per cell. Thus, this method facilitates logistics, standardization, and high recovery for the generation of viable genetically reprogrammed DCs for clinical applications." ;

      dc:description "Leukopenia is a severe condition resulting from both pathological processes and some treatments, like chemotherapy in cancer patients. However, the activation of the patient immune system is required for the success of immunotherapeutic strategies, as cancer vaccines. In this regard, leukopenia constitutes a major hurdle to overcome, mainly due to the impairment of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. Adjuvants are basic components of vaccine formulations, which might be useful to stimulate immunity under this immunosuppressed condition. To this aim, we tested the capacity of a novel nanoparticulated complex, very small size proteoliposomes (VSSP), to promote CTL even in a leukopenic scenario. Noteworthy, we observed that a VSSP-based OVA vaccine induced a normal antigen-specific CTL response in mice rendered leukopenia by the administration of high doses of the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide (CY), while under the same conditions the OVA antigen formulated in the TLR-3 agonist polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (P(I:C)) was ineffective. Moreover, an appropriate combination of VSSP with the P(I:C) vaccine was able to restore the CD8(+) T cell effector function in leukopenic mice. VSSP induced not only a faster repopulation of immune cells in CY-receiving animals, but also enhanced the recovery of memory T lymphocytes and myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) while simultaneously abrogated the immunosuppressive capacity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Our results suggest that VSSP could be a particularly suitable immunomodulator to be used in CTL-promoting active immunotherapy strategies operating in severe immune compromised scenarios." ;

Methods: We reviewed 46 patients with stage II and III primary melanoma at our institution from 2004 through 2009. Twenty-one patients were treated with interferon-β maintenance therapy consisting of subcutaneous injection of natural interferon-β at a dose of 3 × 10(6) IU/day for 10 consecutive days, and 25 patients underwent observation alone. Results: Compared with all patients, overall survival and relapse-free survival were significantly worse in the observation group than in the interferon-β group (p = 0.024 and 0.029, respectively). In stage II, a significant difference in overall survival, but not in relapse-free survival, was seen between the two groups (p = 0.041). When the interferon-β group was stratified by subgroup, there was a statistical difference only between dosage and duration (p = 0.027 and p < 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that maintenance therapy by interferon-β is beneficial in the outcome of the disease without substantial toxic effects, especially in patients with stage II melanoma. Extension of the duration of treatment beyond 2 years could further improve the therapeutic efficacy of interferon-β." ;

      dc:description "OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to determine vitamin B6 status in elderly (age ≥60 years) and younger (age <60 years) recipients of allogeneic kidney graft and to investigate associations between vitamin B6 status and immunity markers. DESIGN: A retrospective observational study. SETTING: The study was conducted at the Medical University of Gdańsk, Poland. SUBJECTS: We recruited 34 kidney allograft recipients (17 males and 17 females) and allocated them into 2 groups: patients aged ≥60 years (18 patients) and those aged <60 years (16 patients). Exclusion criteria included patients receiving vitamin B6 supplementation or drugs known to influence vitamin B6 metabolism. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Plasma levels of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), pyridoxal, pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate, and 4 pyridoxic acid were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Measured immunity markers were serum cytokines (interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and transforming growth factor-β), levels of T-lymphocyte subsets, and the proliferative ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: Concentrations of all vitamin B6 vitamers in plasma (PLP, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate, pyridoxamine, pyridoxine, 4 pyridoxic acid) were comparable in the 2 studied groups. There were no cases of PLP deficiency in the study population, but 29% of patients had PLP concentrations more than the upper reference limit. Vitamin B6 vitamer concentrations were not influenced by gender, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and circulating phosphate concentration. There was no difference in immunity markers according to age. However, the plasma concentrations of vitamin B6 vitamers were inversely associated with levels of CD28(+) lymphocyte subsets, as well as with the proliferative response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: No cases of vitamin B6 deficiency were found among kidney allograft recipients, and we report inverse links between vitamin B6 vitamer concentrations and markers of cellular immunity, suggesting that bioactive vitamin B6 concentration in kidney allograft recipients merits further investigation." ;

      dc:description "Background: Enteric glia cells (EGCs) are essential for the integrity of the bowel. A loss of EGCs leads to a severe inflammation of the intestines. As a diminished EGC network is postulated in Crohn's disease (CD), we aimed to investigate if EGCs could be a target of apoptosis during inflammation in CD, which can be influenced by Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).<br /> Material/Methods: GFAP, BDNF and cCaspase-3 were detected in the gut of patients with CD. Primary EGC cultures were established and cultivated. Tyrosine receptor kinase (TrkB) receptors on these cells were investigated by western blot and immunofluorescence. Rate of apoptosis was induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and interferon (IFN-gamma). Apoptosis was determined by a fluorometric caspase 3/7 activation assay after preincubation of these cells with BDNF or neutralizing anti-BDNF antibodies.<br /> Results: Mucosal GFAP-positive EGCs undergo apoptosis revealed by cCaspase-3 in the gut of patients with CD expressing BDNF highly. The combination of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma was able to induce apoptosis in primary EGCs, whereas these factors alone did not. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) attenuate glia cell apoptosis to a small extent, but neutralizing antibodies against BDNF dramatically increased apoptosis.<br /> Conclusions: Mucosal EGC apoptosis is an important finding in the gut of patients with CD. Proinflammatory cytokines, which are highly increased in CD, induce EGC apoptosis, whereas the neurotrophin BDNF might be protective for EGC. Since EGCs are implicated in the maintenance of the enteric mucosal integrity, EGC apoptosis may contribute to the pathophysiological changes in CD.<br />" ;

      rdfs:comment """We have obtained valuable data on chemically well-defined TLR ligand conjugates and their effectiveness to induce a strong immune response via the cross-presentation pathway. 

We have studied long peptides which were covalently conjugated to either the TLR2 ligand or TLR9 ligand, Pam3CysSK4 or CpG, respectively have been used to study the uptake, antigen presentation, and induction of specific T-cells. A pronounced enhancement in antigen presentation by DC in vitro was facilitated by the conjugated peptides compared to peptide alone, or peptide mixed with the free TLR ligand. Importantly, direct injection of the conjugates or pre-loading of the conjugates onto dendritic cells followed by injection into naïve mice, lead to a robust induction of specific CD8 T-cells, as detected by tetramers staining, compared to mice injected with the peptide mixed with the free TLR ligand. 

With regard to TLR2 ligands, we have investigated the behaviour of two diastereomers of the TLR-2 ligand Pam3CSK4 (Pam) derivatives, namely the R- and S-epimers at C-2 of the glycerol moiety. In this respect we have chemically coupled  either the R-epimer of the Pam3CSK4 or the S-epimer of the Pam3CSK4 to long peptides containing a CTL epitope. We found that the Pam(R)-conjugates lead to better activation of dendritic cells than the Pam(S)-conjugates as judged by higher IL-12 secretion, up-regulation of relevant markers for dendritic cell maturation. In contrast, both epimers were internalized equally efficient in a clathrin-dependent manner indicating no qualitative difference in the uptake of the two stereoisomeric Pam-conjugates. We conclude that the enhanced DC activation is due to enhanced TLR-2 triggering by the Pam(R) conjugate in contrast to the Pam(S) conjugate. Importantly, induction of specific CD8+ T-cells was significantly higher in mice injected with the Pam(R)-conjugates compared to mice injected with the Pam(S)-conjugate. 

These results show that chemically well-defined TLR ligand conjugates induce a strong immune response, significantly more effective than combining the free peptide and the TLR ligand. By combining efficient antigen targeting and DC maturation, TLR ligand conjugates are promising vehicles to deliver antigens via the cross-presentation pathway.""" ;

Hesperetin was revealed to have a therapeutic (PDE4(H)/PDE4(L)) ratio of >11. Hesperetin (10 ~ 30 μmol/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) dose-dependently and significantly attenuated the airway hyperresponsiveness induced by methacholine. It also significantly suppressed the increases in total inflammatory cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils, and levels of cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). It dose-dependently and significantly suppressed total and OVA-specific immunoglobulin E levels in the BALF and serum. However, hesperetin did not influence xylazine/ketamine-induced anesthesia, suggesting that hesperetin has few or no emetic effects. In conclusion, the rationales for ameliorating allergic asthma and COPD by hesperetin are anti-inflammation, immunoregulation, and bronchodilation." ;

A shave biopsy from the cheek of a 58-year-old man demonstrated a thin invasive melanoma of 0.3 mm thickness with a less than 2-mm-wide intra-epidermal component. Below this melanocytic lesion, but not contiguous with it, there was a transected S-100-positive and Melan-A-negative spindle cell proliferation. Upon re-excision, no residuum of conventional melanoma was identified, but a residual spindle cell neoplasm that was 4 mm in diameter, nodular, well-circumscribed, cytologically bland, and S-100 positive was noted. At our consensus conference, our group favored neurofibroma but agreed that spindle cell melanoma could not be excluded based on histopathologic features alone. To further address the differential diagnosis, we performed CD34 staining that demonstrated lack of a CD34 fingerprint. We also completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization, which demonstrated gain of chromosome 6p, loss of 6p and gain of 7. These two methods of analysis support a diagnosis of spindle cell melanoma." ;

      rdfs:comment """We are progressing steadily towards the delivery of a standardized method for the immuno-monitoring of DC vaccination trials using a finite number of defined tumor antigens. Our starting point was the method that we had developed previously to estimate blood frequencies of CD8 T lymphocytes against one defined antigenic peptide. It was based on an in vitro restimulation of blood lymphocytes with the peptide and growth factors over two weeks followed by detection with the appropriate HLA class I tetramer. In order to estimate frequencies of responding cells, these mixed lymphocyte peptide cultures (MLPC) are conducted in limiting dilution condition. We have validated two important modifications to this protocol. 

i)  MLPC/tetramer with multiple peptides presented by HLA class I molecules. We now have a stimulation method that can be used for up to 8 antigenic peptides simultaneously, all presented by HLA class I molecules. To avoid competition between the peptides for HLA binding, the initial stimulation of the PBMC is carried out by dividing the initial population into 8 fractions, each of which is pulsed with one peptide, and pooling these individually pulsed fractions before the distribution into the limiting dilution microcultures. For tetramer detection, we obtain similar results with either of two methods. The first is simply to mix all tetramers, a procedure that, if each reagent is carefully titrated, does not generate a disturbing non specific labeling. A positive microculture has then to be retested individually with each tetramer. The advantage of this procedure is that the initial screening has to be carried out only once. This procedure is applicable when the proportion of positive microcultures is low. The second method is to carry out the screening with mixes of three tetramers with an overlap of one. For tetramers 1-8 this gives 1,2,3 and 3,4,5 and 5,6,7 and 7,8,1. Here the initial screening uses four labelings, but one can immediately determine which antigen is recognized in which microculture. 

ii) MLPC/tetramer including a peptide presented by HLA class II molecules. With the availability of a new type of HLA class II tetramer, consisting of recombinant HLA-DP4 molecules folded with the MAGE-A3 peptide presented by DP4, we could test whether the MLPC/tetramer method could be used also for a vaccine peptide recognized by CD4 T cells. We found out that the addition of the MAGE-3.DP4 peptide to the mix of 8 peptides described above allowed for the stimulation, in the same microcultures, of both CD4 and CD8 peptide-specific responder cells. Tetramer detection was as sensitive as for the class I reagents and could be performed simultaneously. This improvement could be very useful for all the trials that combine class I and class II antigenic peptides.""" ;

      dc:description "In efforts to identify novel small molecules with anti-inflammatory properties, we discovered a unique series of tetracyclic indenoquinoxaline derivatives that inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NF-κB/AP-1 activation. Compound IQ-1 (11H-indeno[1,2-b]quinoxalin-11-one oxime) was found to be a potent, non-cytotoxic inhibitor of pro-inflammatory cytokine [interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)] and nitric oxide production by human and murine monocyte/macrophages. Three additional potent inhibitors of cytokine production were identified through further screening of IQ-1 analogs. The sodium salt of IQ-1 inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-6 production in MonoMac-6 cells with IC(50) values of 0.25 and 0.61 μM, respectively. Screening of 131 protein kinases revealed that derivative IQ-3 (11H-indeno[1,2-b]quinoxalin-11-one-O-(2-furoyl)oxime) was a specific inhibitor of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) family, with preference for JNK3. This compound, as well as IQ-1 and three additional oxime indenoquinoxalines, were found to be high-affinity JNK inhibitors with nanomolar binding affinity and ability to inhibit c-Jun phosphorylation. Furthermore, docking studies showed that hydrogen bonding interactions of the active indenoquinoxalines with Asn152, Gln155, and Met149 of JNK3 played an important role in enzyme binding activity. Finally, we showed that the sodium salt of IQ-1 had favorable pharmacokinetics and inhibited the ovalbumin-induced CD4(+) T-cell immune response in a murine delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) model in vivo. We conclude that compounds with an indenoquinoxaline nucleus can serve as specific small-molecule modulators for mechanistic studies of JNKs, as well as a potential leads for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs." ;

      dc:description "PURPOSE: Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) are anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines which can influence cancer-directed immunosurveillance. Nothing is presently known about expression of these cytokines and their receptors (IL-4R and IL-13R) in colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to characterize their expression in primary colorectal cancer specimens and to evaluate possible functions for this disease. METHODS: Expression of IL-4, IL-13, IL-4R, and IL-13R protein was characterized by immunohistochemistry in 359 patients with Union for International Cancer Control stage I-III colorectal cancer and evaluated by uni- and multivariate analysis for their prognostic relevance. RESULTS: All four proteins were expressed in colorectal cancer specimens. In the cancer cells, high IL-4, IL-13, IL-4R, and IL-13R immunoreactivity were present in 33 % (118/359), 50 % (181/359), 36 % (129/359), and 42 % (152/359), respectively. Patients with high expression of IL-4, IL-4R, and IL-13R had a lower frequency of lymph node metastases. Expression of IL-13 did not influence the frequency of lymph node metastases. However, high IL-13-immunoreactivity was associated with a better overall survival (p = 0.041). Expression of IL-4, IL-4R, or IL-13R did not influence survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that besides pT classification and tumor recurrence, IL-13 expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of IL-4, IL-4R, and IL-13R are involved in the process of local metastases in colorectal cancer, while IL-13 expression has an impact on survival. These interleukins and their receptors may become attractive targets for the treatment of colorectal cancer." ;

      dc:description "Hematopoietic cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of malignant diseases. This study compared the diagnostic utility of hematopoietic growth factors with commonly accepted tumor marker (CA 125) in the early stages (I and II) of endometrial cancer (EC) patients (65) in relation to the control groups: uterine myoma patients (40) and healthy subjects (45). The pretreatment plasma levels of interleukin 3, stem cell factor, granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) were determined by the use of immunoenzyme assay, and those of CA 125 were determined by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Our results have demonstrated significant differences in the concentration of cytokines and CA 125 between the groups of EC patients, uterine myoma patients, and the healthy controls. M-CSF has demonstrated equal to CA 125 or higher values of the diagnostic sensitivity, the predictive values of positive and negative test results, and the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve in the tested groups. These findings suggest the usefulness of M-CSF in the diagnosis of EC and uterine myomas." ;

      rdfs:comment """Using the MLPC/tetramer method described last year, we obtained data by pursuing the immunological monitoring of melanoma patients vaccinated with 4 peptides (MAGE-A3, gp100, NA17 and tyrosinase) presented by HLA-A2. We measured responses to these peptides injected with Montanide, but did not know whether the Montanide adjuvant was important for these T cell responses. Indeed, melanoma patients may mount spontaneous responses to these antigenic peptides. We therefore injected the same peptides without adjuvant, and no response was observed. We conclude that Montanide had a clear adjuvant effect for the CD8 T cell responses measured against these four peptides.

Tumor regressions have been observed in a small proportion of melanoma patients vaccinated with a MAGE-A3 peptide presented by HLA-A1, administered as peptide, ALVAC canarypox virus containing a MAGE-A3 minigene, or peptide-pulsed dendritic cells (DC). There was a correlation between tumor regression and detection of anti-MAGE-3.A1 CTL responses. These responses were monoclonal and often of a very low magnitude after vaccination with peptide or ALVAC, and usually polyclonal and of a higher magnitude after DC vaccination. These results suggested that, at least in some patients, surprisingly few anti-MAGE-3.A1 T cells could initiate a tumor regression process. 

To understand the role of these T cells, we performed a functional analysis of anti-MAGE-3.A1 CTL clones derived from vaccinated patients who displayed tumor regression. The functional avidities of these CTL clones, evaluated in lysis assays, were surprisingly low, suggesting that high avidity was not part of the putative capability of these CTL to trigger tumor rejection. Most anti-MAGE-3.A1 CTL clones obtained after DC vaccination, but not after peptide or ALVAC vaccination, produced IL-10. Transcript profiling confirmed this result and indicated that about 20 genes, including CD40L, prostaglandin D2 synthase, granzyme K and granzyme H, were differentially expressed between the anti-MAGE-3.A1 CTL clones derived from patients vaccinated with peptide-ALVAC or with peptide-pulsed DC. These results indicate that the modality of vaccination with a tumor-specific antigen influences the differentiation pathway of the anti-vaccine CD8 T cells, which may have an impact on their capacity to trigger a tumor rejection response.

This data is extremely relevant for the design and performance of the immunomonitoring of the new clinical trial WP19.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """We are collecting immunological data from a melanoma patient, aiming to identify the antigen(s) recognized by T cells from this patient that experienced an outstanding response to immunotherapy. This patient received several adoptive T cell transfers and regressed from stage IV melanoma to a disease free state and has remained tumor free for several years. In a collaboration with Dr. O. Winqvist, Karolinska Institute, we attempted to improve the adoptive transfer protocol by stimulating T cells with monocyte derived DC pulsed with tumor lysate, instead of simply adding tumor lysate into PBMC cultures. T cells raised exhibited some tumor reactivity and outgrowth of a distinct T cell population could be observed. We intented to identify the target antigen recognized by the tumor reactive T cells in order to further improve T cell stimulations and to possibly complement treatment with DC vaccination. 

We then evaluated the capacity of autologous DC and HEK293 cells transfected with relevant HLA alleles to function as T cell targets in Elispot assays upon transfection with tumor antigen encoding plasmids. Due to strong background from the autologous DC we decided that HEK293 transfected with one HLA-allele at a time plus simultaneously transfected with up to 5 tumor antiges would be optimal to screen for antigen specificity in the patients T cells. However, during a second T cell culture to expand large numbers of T cells for this screening procedure a drastic expansion of regulatory T cells was observed. Since no sufficient number of T cells could be expanded the screening was not performed. The reason for the altered phenotype/function of the expanded T cells from the second bleeding of this patient is currently not known.""" ;

      dc:description "Immune response against a foreign antigen is characterized by a growth phase, in which antigen-specific T cells clonally expand, followed by a decline phase in which the activated T cells undergo apoptosis, a process termed activation-induced cell death (AICD). In the current study, we have investigated the phase at which 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p-dioxin (TCDD) acts to downregulate the antigen-specific T cell response. To this end, C57BL/6 +/+ mice were injected with staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) into the footpads (10 micro g/footpad), and simultaneously treated with TCDD (10 or 50 micro g/kg intraperitoneally). At various time points, the draining lymph node (LN) cells were analyzed for SEA-activated T cells. The data demonstrated that in C57BL/6 +/+ mice, TCDD treatment did not alter the growth phase but facilitated the decline phase of SEA-reactive T cells. TCDD caused a significant decrease in the percentage and absolute numbers of CD4(+) and CD8(+) SEA-responsive T cells expressing Vbeta3(+) and Vbeta11(+) but did not affect SEA-nonresponsive Vbeta8(+) T cells. Upon in vitro culture, TCDD-exposed SEA-immunized LN cells exhibited increased levels of apoptosis when compared with the vehicle controls. When Fas-deficient (C57BL/6 lpr/lpr) or Fas ligand defective (C57BL/6 gld/gld) mice were treated with TCDD, they failed to exhibit a decrease in percentage and cellularity of SEA-reactive T cells, thereby suggesting a role of Fas-Fas ligand interactions in the TCDD-induced downregulation of SEA-reactive T cell response. The resistance to TCDD-induced decrease in T cell responsiveness to SEA seen in Fas- and FasL-mutant mice was neither due to decreased aryl hydrocabon receptor (AhR) expression nor to altered T cell responsiveness to SEA. The current study demonstrates that TCDD does not prevent T cell activation, but prematurely induces Fas-based AICD, which may contribute to the deletion of antigen-primed T cells." ;

Therapeutic vaccinations strongly delay tumor growth or even prevent tumors from growing out. By depleting CD4+ and CD8+ cell populations prior to tumor challenge, CD8+ cells were identified as the main effector cells involved. Importantly, DCs pre-loaded in vitro with ICs are at least 1000-fold more potent than ICs injected directly into mice or DCs loaded with the same amount of non-complexed protein. FcgammaRs on DCs were required for efficient priming of Ag-specific CD8+ cells in vivo and induction of tumor protection. These findings show that targeting ICs via the activating FcgammaRs to DCs in vitro is superior to direct IC vaccination to induce protective tumor immunity in vivo. """ ;

      rdfs:comment """A comprehensive protein inventory of clinical grade immature and cytokine cocktail matured (Il-6, IL-1 beta, TNF alpha, PGE2; 48 hours) monocyte derived human dendritic cells (DC) from a healthy donor has been established by using high accuracy, high sensitivity protein identification technology. We have identified 2794 proteins in DCs by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Prior to MS analysis, DC were lysed and divided into a soluble fraction containing cytosolic proteins and into an insoluble fraction enriched for membrane containing proteins.  Highly complex protein mixtures of DC cellular fractions were separated on 1 D SDS-PAGE into 20 gel slices (fractions), followed by in-gel digestion with trypsin. Purified tryptic peptides were analysed in triplicate by LC-MS/MS using a linear ion trap/ Fourier Transform (LTQ-FT) hybrid mass spectrometer. 

Iterative calibration algorithms were used to achieve a final, absolute mass accuracy of better than 10 parts per million (p.p.m.) for all peptide ions. These high-accuracy spectra were searched against a human protein database, using MASCOT probability-based scoring in which the fragment ions are matched against the calculated fragments of all tryptic peptides from the human sequences. Additional constraints were set by searches against a reversed human database to minimize false positive protein identifications. These criteria resulted in a list of 2794 unique proteins that were identified with high confidence, comprising of 2623 proteins detected in immature DCs, 1896 proteins in mature DCs, and 1725 proteins in both cell types. Differences were quantified by the exponentially modified Protein Abundance Index (emPAI) method, a label free spectral counting procedure for determining relative protein amounts of LC-MS/MS data.

Protein expression profiles were compared with gene expression profiles generated by microarray technology (M2.2). In total, we could map 96 percent of the detected proteins to expressed genes for the immature DCs and 90 percent for the mature DCs. A Pearson correlation analysis revealed for both cell types, good correlations, respectively 0.57 and 0.50. These correlations are in good agreement with similar correlation studies, where correlation coefficients approximately range from 0.2-0.7 for large scale datasets.  These studies include quantitative highly accurate proteomic data generated by chemically-or metabolically-labeled approaches.  Therefore, we conclude that our data contains sufficient quantitative information to define subsets of up- and down-regulated proteins for functional analysis. We find 202 proteins upregulated by more than 2 fold in mature DCs and 463 proteins upregulated in immature DCs. 

Functional annotation by gene ontology classification and pathway analysis by several bioinformatics approaches have been performed. Preliminary results obtained from querying DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) and Ontologizer (http://www.charite.de/ch/medgen/ontologizer/) show statistically significant enrichment for immunological-relevant signaling pathways and immunology-related GO terms of the upregulated proteins in mature DCs.""" ;

In addition, CD83 mRNA-electroporated DC are stronger T cell stimulators. However, CD83 overexpression on Melan-A/MART-1-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) circumvents the need for CD83 expression on DC. Co-culture of immature DC with TIL or K562 cells overexpressing CD83 results in the production of enhanced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas this production is less pronounced or even absent in co-cultures with non-modified TIL or K562 cells.

      rdfs:comment """We performed experiments to set up the optimal conditions for both transient transfection of synthetic siRNAs and lentiviral transduction of shRNAs into DC. 

To optimize transfection efficiency, while minimizing toxicity, non targeting FITC-conjugated siRNA were transfected in two different experimental settings: 

a) fresh monocytes and 
b) immature DCs (iDCs) obtained from monocytes in the presence of GM-CSF/IL-4. 

In both experimental settings a considerably high transfection efficiency (up to 75%) was achieved in the absence of significant cell death. Moreover, the percentage of siRNA-FITC+ cells did not decline with time (up to 5 days post-transfection) suggesting high siRNA stability inside the DCs, in agreement with previously published data. 

To optimize lentiviral delivery, experiments using a self-inactivating lentiviral vector (LV) expressing enhanced GFP (eGFP) from an internal CMV promoter were performed. DCs cells were transduced at different multiplicity of infection. FACS analysis indicated a good transfection efficiency (up to 80%). Evaluation of the effect of lentiviral infection on DC phenotype/activation, revealed that LV infection per se neither modified DC phenotype/activation state nor significantly interfered with their capacity to mature upon appropriate stimulation. 

These approaches are currently being used to silence the transcription factor IRF4, and finely dissect its recently discovered function during human myeloid DC differentiation. 

They will also be applied to the selective silencing of ILT3 (see below), based on the working hypothesis that disrupting molecular pathways leading to tolerance may result in the generation of a DC more successful in stimulating the proper immune response against tumours. """ ;

We demonstrated using this syngeneic mouse tumor model that the inadequate nature of the antitumor CTL response is not due to direct Ag presentation by the tumor cells, but results from presentation of tumor-derived Ag by nonactivated CD11c(+) APC. Although this event results in division of naive CTL in tumor draining lymph nodes, it does not establish a productive immune response. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with dendritic cell-stimulating agonistic anti-CD40 mAb resulted in systemic efflux of CTL with robust effector function capable to eradicate established tumors. For efficacy of anti-CD40 treatment, CD40 ligation of host APC is required because adoptive transfer of CD40-proficient tumor-specific TCR transgenic CTL into CD40-deficient tumor-bearing mice did not lead to productive antitumor immunity after CD40 triggering in vivo. CpG and detoxified LPS (MPL) acted similarly as agonistic anti-CD40 mAb with respect to CD8(+) CTL efflux and tumor eradication. Together these results indicate that dendritic cells, depending on their activation state, orchestrate the outcome of CTL-mediated immunity against tumors, leading either to an ineffective immune response or potent antitumor immunity.""" ;

They interact with fucosylated and sialylated ligands bearing sialyl-Lewis X as a minimal carbohydrate structure. With this in mind, it should be expected that individuals with deficient fucosylation or sialylation show immunodeficiency. However, as this review shows, the picture appears to be more complex and more interesting. Although there are only few patients with such glycosylation defects, they have turned out to be very instructive for our understanding of the functions of fucosylation and sialylation in immunity, development and hemostasis." ;

IFN gamma ELISPOT as basic assay (costs, workload) that can be frequently performed in every patient for routine monitoring

      dc:description "Melanoma antigen-encoding gene 3 (MAGE-3) is an ideal candidate for a tumor vaccine although its potency need to be increased. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) represents a potential approach for increasing the potency of DNA vaccines. In the present study, a fusion DNA vaccine composed of Mycobacterium tuberculosis HSP70 and MAGE-3 was constructed and used to immunize C57BL/6 mice against B16 or B16-MAGE-3 tumor cells. The results show that the HSP70-MAGE-3 fusion DNA vaccine enhanced the frequency of MAGE-3-specific cytotoxic T-cells as compared to the MAGE-3 DNA vaccine or the HSP70/MAGE-3 cocktail DNA vaccine (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the results indicate that the HSP70-MAGE-3 fusion DNA vaccine can strongly activate MAGE-3 specific cellular immunological reactions and thus significantly inhibit the growth of B16-MAGE-3 tumors, improving the survival of tumor-bearing mice, and the HSP70-MAGE-3 fusion DNA vaccine has a significant therapeutic effect on the tumors that express MAGE-3 antigens." ;

We studied TcR-Tg clones specific of each antigen (P14-GP33 specific, 0T-1-OVA specific), as well as endogenous polyclonal T cells, specific for the same antigens, identified by MHC pentamers loaded with specific peptides. In each individual T cell, we studied the expression of twenty different genes either mediating effector functions, or coding for different receptors involved in T cell differentiation and memory generation. We were surprised to observe that each type of infection induced peculiar expression of the effector molecules or receptors expressed by responding cells, thus generating unique divergent differentiation patterns.  Endogenous LCMV polyclonal T cells and P14 T cells showed the same differentiation patterns that were different from those of OT-1 T cells responding to Listeria-OVA. These results suggest that CD8 differentiation is dependent of the infectious context, rather than of the TCR specificity. 

Our present studies aim to confirm this notion.  For that purpose, we will challenge P14 LCMV-GP33 specific T cells with the Listeria-GP33, to identify if these cells now express a pattern of differentiation similar to OT-1 T cells responding to Listeria-OVA. Whatever the mechanisms, these results describe for the first time alternative pathways of CD8 differentiation, that have nothing in common with those of CD4 T cells, since divergent gene expression does not mimic at all Th1 and TH2 differentiation.""" ;

Lymphoid tissue plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells (DCs) are continuously regenerated from hematopoietic stem cells. The cytokine dependence and biology of plasmacytoid and conventional DCs suggest that regeneration might proceed through common DC-restricted developmental intermediates. By selecting for cytokine receptor expression relevant to DC development, we were able to identify highly cycling Lin–c-KitintFlt3+M-CSFR+ cells with a distinct gene-expression profile in mouse bone marrow that, on a clonal level in vitro and as a population both in vitro and in vivo, efficiently generated plasmacytoid and conventional DCs but no other lineages, which increased in number after in vivo injection of the cytokine Flt3 ligand. These clonogenic common DC progenitors (CDP) thus define a cytokine-regulated DC developmental pathway that ensures the supply of various DC populations in vivo.""" ;

      dc:description "BACKGROUNDAnimal experiments have suggested that a high intraperitoneal pressure (IPP) might adversely affect the surgical peritoneal environment. The present experimental study investigates the impact of IPP of a CO(2) pneumoperitoneum on human peritoneum.METHODSPatients undergoing laparoscopic surgery were subjected to either low (8 mmHg) or standard (12 mmHg) IPP. Normal peritoneum was collected from the parietal wall at the beginning of surgery and every 60 min thereafter. Expression levels of 168 genes that encode extracellular matrix proteins, adhesion molecules or inflammatory cytokine signaling molecules were measured in peritoneal tissues using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay panels. Human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) and human peritoneal fibroblasts (HPFBs) were incubated in a CO(2) insufflation chamber for 1 h at 12 or 8 mmHg. Hyaluronan (HA) synthesis and mRNA expression levels of hyaluronic acid synthases (HAS) and hyaluronidases (Hyal) in HPMCs and HPFBs were measured at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h after CO(2) gas exposure by ELISA and real-time PCR, respectively.RESULTSExpression levels of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), matrix metalloproteinase-9, E-selectin, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 (CXCL-2), Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 were significantly higher and those of HAS-1, HAS-3, thrombospondin-2 (TSP-2) and interleukin-10 were significantly lower in the 12 mmHg group compared with the 8 mmHg group. HA synthesis was significantly lower in the 12 mmHg group compared with the 8 mmHg group in HPMCs and HPFBs throughout the time course.CONCLUSIONSA low IPP (8 mmHg) may be better than the standard IPP (12 mmHg) to minimize the adverse impact on the surgical peritoneal environment during a CO(2) pneumoperitoneum." ;

We have concentrated on the evaluation of the interplay between the hematopoetic factor Flt3L and IFNalpha,beta and have data available from our studies. We found that the cooperation between IFNalpha,beta and Flt3L (FL) plays an important role in the defense against Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in neonates. Treatment of neonatal mice with recombinant IFNalpha has a short-term, FL-independent and a long-term, FL-dependent protective effect against HSV-1. In mice lacking FL, neonatal resistance against HSV-1 is very low and DC numbers in the spleen are reduced. The treatment of these mice with rIFNalpha at day 6 resulted in an increased resistance against infection with HSV-1 at day 7. In C57BL/6 mice, treatment with rIFNalpha at birth induced both FL and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) that resulted in enhanced resistance against HSV-1 at day 7. In contrast, in mice lacking FL, IFNalpha treatment at birth did not influence splenic cell composition and had no effect on viral protection. The transfer of pDC to mice lacking FL enhanced viral resistance. Therefore, the induction and function of pDC, normally controlled by IFNalpha,beta and FL, are decisive for viral resistance in neonatal mice." ;

We aimed to analyse NRTI effects on the content of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and B-cells, and on their proliferation and antibody synthesis. METHODS: Peripheral blood B-lymphocytes from six healthy individuals were stimulated in vitro with interleukin-4 and Staphylococcus aureus superantigen in the presence or absence of NRTI in concentrations equivalent to, or fivefold exceeding, human peak plasma levels. We also tested the effects of uridine, a pyrimidine precursor, which has antagonized NRTI toxicities in other models. RESULTS: During 9 days of culture, B-lymphocyte proliferation and vitality were not affected by NRTI. Didanosine and stavudine, but not zidovudine, dose-dependently induced mtDNA depletion. All three NRTI significantly and dose-dependently impaired the synthesis of all immunoglobulin classes. The lymphocytotoxic effects of the thymidine analogues zidovudine and stavudine on B-lymphocytes were antagonized by the addition of uridine. CONCLUSIONS: Didanosine, stavudine and zidovudine induce mitochondrial toxicity in human B-lymphocytes and impair the immunoglobulin synthesis in vitro, warranting further studies on their in vivo effects." ;

RAW cells activated by titanium particles were transduced with DFG-IL-1Ra (retroviral vector encoding IL-1 receptor antagonist) and AAV-OPG (adeno-associated viral vectors-osteoprotegerin) individually or in combination for 4 weeks. Pro-inflammatory cytokines in culture media were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and gene expressions of RANK, IL-1β, c-Fos, TRAF6, JNK1 and CPK were examined using real-time PCR. An established knee-implant-failure mouse model was employed to evaluate the efficacy of the in vivo double-gene therapy. The surgical implantation of a titanium alloy pin into the proximal tibia was followed by monthly challenge with titanium debris. Peri-implant gene transfers of IL-1Ra and OPG (respectively or in combination) were given 3 weeks after surgery. The combination of OPG and IL-1Ra gene transfer exhibited strong synergetic effects in blockage of inflammation and osteoclastogenesis at 8 weeks after gene modification. The combination therapy reversed peri-implant bone resorption and restored implant stability when compared with either single gene transduction. Real-time PCR data indicated that the action of IL-1Ra gene therapy may be mediated via the JNK1 pathway, while the reduction of osteoclastogenesis by OPG gene modification may be regulated by c-Fos expression. In addition, both gene modifications resulted in significant diminishment of TRAF6 expression.Gene Therapy advance online publication, 9 February 2012; doi:10.1038/gt.2012.1." ;

      rdfs:comment """We have microarray data on macrophages and DC from different genetic backgrounds of mice, stimulated with CpG, in the presence or absence of a MEK inhibitor, and further data on the role of certain MAP kinases in the regulation of IL-10 and IL-12, IFN-gamma production.

Using pharmacological inhibitors, or macrophages and DC from mice carrying a null mutation in MAP kinase signalling molecule(s), we have evidence for a role of certain MAP kinases in the regulation of IL-10 and IL-12, IFN-gamma production. The work on the role of the MAP kinases, TPL-2 and ERK in upregulation of IL-10 production and negative regulation of IL-12 and IFN-gamma induction, has been under review with the Journal of Experimental Medicine and is now about to be resubmitted – this has taken longer than expected due to breeding problems with mice and the requirement to make new retroviral transcription factor constructs as requested by the reviewers (Kaiser, Cooke, Rajsbaum, Wu, Papoutsopoulou, Ley,and O’Garra). 

This work forms the basis of the microarray analysis of macrophages and DC from different genetic backgrounds of mice, stimulated with CpG, in the presence or absence of a MEK inhibitor, to identify downstream transcription factors responsible for the regulation of IL-10, IL-12 and IFN-gamma in collaboration with P. Ricciardi Castagnoli. Additional findings on the dominant role of the MAP kinase p38 in TLR ligand induced production of IL-10 were published (Kaiser. Wu, O’Garra et al; and one collaborative paper has been published (Papoutsopoulou et al., 2006). 

Furthermore, R. Rajsbaum has published a manuscript in the European Journal of Immunology, titled “Type-1 Interferon-dependent and independent expression of tripartite motif proteins in immune cells” by Ricardo Rajsbaum, Jonathan P. Stoye and Anne O’Garra. In this paper he has revealed that TRIM molecules can be grouped in clusters based on their patterns of mRNA expression in the different cell populations.  His main work shows that a group of TRIMs that share similar structural features, namely the COS-FN3 domains important in protein-protein interactions and localization to the microtubules, are preferentially expressed in the CD4+ T cell subsets, suggesting they may share a common function in these cells. On the other hand, a different cluster of TRIMs is constitutively expressed at high levels in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). Conversely, he found that a different group containing a large number of TRIM genes are induced in primary mouse macrophages, myeloid DC (mDC) and pDC upon influenza virus infection in a type-1 IFN dependent manner, suggesting an anti-viral function. However, stimulation of macrophages and mDC with LPS and double stranded RNA also led to type-1 IFN dependent up-regulation of these TRIM genes, demonstrating that their expression is not directly regulated by the virus, and that they may have broader functions in innate immune responses. A subgroup of the TRIMs induced in macrophages and DC by viruses in a type-I IFN dependent manner, mapped to mouse chromosome 7, which is syntenic to human chromosome 11, where TRIMs with known anti-viral activity are localised, suggesting that they may have co-evolved to combat viruses. The study highlights the importance of TRIM molecules as effectors of the innate immune response.

The analysis of this data resulted from R. Rajsbaum training on the Mugen Course run by Castagnoli, and forms the basis of analysis of the data obtained in the microarray study listed below which is a collaboration with Prof. Ricciardi-Castagnoli, which he and Xuemei Wu have been analysing in the last months. 

RNA was sent to Partner P. Ricciardi Castagnoli (UNIMIB) for microarray analysis of macrophages and DC from different genetic backgrounds of mice, stimulated with CpG, in the presence or absence of a MEK inhibitor, to identify downstream transcription factors responsible for the regulation of IL-10, IL-12 and IFN-??. (experiments performed by X. Wu & R.Rajsbaum are accomplished as part of those experiments). We have received the data and Ricardo Rajsbaum and Xuemei Wu are currently analysing.
My group is (Ricardo Rajsbaum and Xuemei Wu) is involved in the pathway analysis database initiative. Regarding the knowledge portal, the microarray data on our experiment will be submitted in the coming year and a manuscript will be submitted for publication in collaboration with Prof. Ricciardi Castagnoli. Information on protocols to generate DCs etc have been submitted by the student, Ricardo Rajsbaum and will be placed on the portal.""" ;

i) The development of protocols to refold in vitro CD1 molecules, which were used for the generation of CD1 tetramers. Ability to generate CD1d tetramers has provided us with the opportunity of comparing a broad panel of CD1d binding compounds for their ability to stimulate iNKT cells. 

ii) Identification of a novel population of NKT cells, which does not express the canonical invariant Valpha24 / Vbeta11 TCR . 

iii) Crystal structures of CD1b molecules loaded with phosphatidylinositol, ganglioside GM2 and glucomonomycolate and more recently of human CD1d loaded with alpha-GalCer. 

iv) Crystal structures of canonical and non canonical NKT TCR.  

v) Demonstration that stimulation of iNKT cells in vivo with the synthetic CD1d ligand alpha-GalCer significantly enhances immune responses to protein and peptide based vaccines, due to rapid iNKT dependent DC maturation. 

vi) We have also described the impact of combining injection of protein vaccines with a combination of iNKT cell-agonist alpha-GalCer and MPL, a detoxified version of LPS that signals through TLR4. This combination treatment stimulates antigen-specific T and B cell responses that are greater than those elicited with alpha-GalCer or MPL alone. Over the next few months we intend to extend these results to a new class of NKT cell agonist, which we have recently described, which are like alpha galactosylceramide have non-glycosidic lipids.  

vii) Characterisation of Siglec-H as a novel endocytic receptor expressed on murine plasmacytoid dendritic cell precursors. Siglec-H functioned as an endocytic receptor and mediated efficient internalization of anti-Siglec-H Abs. By immunizing mice with ovalbumin-conjugated anti-Siglec-H Ab in the presence of CpG, we demonstrate generation of antigen-specific CD8 T cells in vivo. Targeting Siglec-H may therefore be a useful way of delivering antigens to pDCs for cross presentation.""" ;

Tumor growth is supported by tumor stroma, which is made by matrix and infiltrating cells, such as tumor associated macrophages (TAM) and tumor associated dendritic cells (TADC). We have recently reported that TAM display massive nuclear localization of the p50 NF-kB inhibitory homodimer, which correlates with impaired inflammatory functions (Saccani et al., 2006).The functional significance of this observation was demonstrated in p50 NF-kB deficient mice, which displayed tumor growth inhibition. More recently, in order to evaluate whether this tolerogenic mechanisms may target other compartments of the immune system, we characterized the role of p50 NF-kB in dendritic cells (DC) functions, including their differentiation and maturation. Our new results demonstrate that p50 NF-kB plays a non redundant role in DC survival and APC functions. p50 NF-kB has proapoptotic functions in bone marrow derived DC, as its absence leads to a reduced rate of apoptosis/necrosis in DC activated for 48h with LPS. Moreover, after 48h of LPS stimulation, p50 -/- DC that are still alive (80% vs 40% of WT DC) display higher expression of MHC molecules and CCR7, as well as higher secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-18. This correlates with the enhanced capability of p50-/- DC to activate T cell responses, in vitro and in vivo.
Our data suggest that targeting p50 NF-kB activity may represent a strategy to enhance selective DC functions, with potential application in anti-tumor vaccination strategies.

Protocols of antitumor vaccination will be set to explore the therapeutic potential of p50-/- DC. Both approaches aim to provide additional significant advancements in these topics.""" ;

METHODS: An RNAi plasmid for survivin was transfected into SKOV3 cells, and the effect of shRNA targeting survivin on the expression of survivin was determined. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), flow cytometry, and TUNEL staining were used to assess apoptosis. The MTT assay was used to measure cell growth and changes in cisplatin sensitivity. SKOV3 cells were injected into nude mice, and the effect of shRNA targeting the survivin gene on tumor growth was assessed. RESULTS: SKOV3 cells transfected with an RNAi plasmid against survivin had increased apoptosis and slower growth. At the molecular level, these cells also had lower expression of survivin. Nude mice inoculated with SKOV3 cells developed cancers, and treatment with shRNA targeting survivin markedly inhibited the growth of these cancers with no obvious side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies of SKOV3 cells and ovarian cancer xenografts in nude mice indicate that shRNA targeting survivin has potential for the treatment of ovarian cancer." ;

We examined plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules in early pregnancy, to assess their ability to predict preeclampsia. METHODS:: In a prospective longitudinal study, 2600 women with singleton pregnancies and no history of hypertension were recruited at their antenatal hospital (booking) visit at gestational week 12-16. Of these, 49 (1.9%) developed preeclampsia, whereas 74 women matched for age and BMI with uncomplicated pregnancies were selected as controls. A subset of women with risk factors for preeclampsia were sampled again at gestational weeks 16 and 28 (11 cases, 39 controls) and postnatally (six cases, 36 controls). RESULTS:: From multiplex analysis, soluble E-selectin concentrations were higher at 12-16 weeks in women who subsequently developed preeclampsia (15.1 ± 4.9 versus 12.9 ± 4.5 ng/ml, P = 0.02). At gestational week 28, E-selectin concentrations were again higher in women who went on to develop preeclampsia compared with controls (14.4 ± 5.6 versus 10.7 ± 3.5 ng/ml, P = 0.010), whereas levels were not different between the two groups in postpartum samples. CONCLUSION:: Changes in soluble E-selectin concentration in early pregnancy may reflect underlying pathophysiological processes, potentially providing mechanistic insights into preeclampsia." ;

Dysregulation of IL-10 is associated with enhanced immunopathology in response to infection as well as increased risk for development of many autoimmune diseases. Thus a fundamental understanding of IL-10 gene expression is critical for our comprehension of disease progression and resolution of host inflammatory response. In this review, we discuss modes of regulation of IL-10 gene expression in immune effector cell types, including signal transduction, epigenetics, promoter architecture, and post-transcriptional regulation, and how aberrant regulation contributes to immunopathology and disease progression." ;

Purpurogallin plays an important role in inhibiting glutathione S-transferase, xanthine oxidase, catechol O-methyltransferase activities and is effective in the cell protection of several cell types. However, the anti-inflammatory functions of purpurogallin are not well studied. Here, we determined the effects of purpurogallin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated proinflammatory responses. The results showed that purpurogallin inhibited LPS-mediated barrier hyper-permeability, monocyte adhesion and migration and such inhibitory effects were significantly correlated with the inhibitory functions of purpurogallin on LPS-mediated cell adhesion molecules (vascular cell adhesion molecules, intracellular cell adhesion molecule, E-selectin). Furthermore, LPS-mediated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) releases from HUVECs were inhibited by purpurogallin. Given these results, purpurogallin showed its anti-inflammatory activities and could be a candidate as a therapeutic agent for various systemic inflammatory diseases.

      rdfs:comment """We investigated the effects of tumour hypoxia on DC differentiation and maturation and gathered data in mice. 

This is a an important topic as sites of inflammation are often characterized by both low oxygen tension and an extensive infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes, including DC, which need to move against oxygen gradients. We showed that oxygen availability is necessary to promote full monocyte-derived DC differentiation and maturation. Low oxygen tension (hypoxia) inhibits expression of several differentiation and maturation markers (CD1a, CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86, and MHC class II molecules) in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as their stimulatory capacity for T-cell functions. These events are paralleled by impaired up-regulation of the chemokine receptor CCR7, an otherwise necessary event for the homing of mature DCs to lymph nodes. In contrast, hypoxia strongly up-regulates production of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly TNFalpha and IL-1beta, as well as the inflammatory chemokine receptor CCR5. Subcutaneous injection of hypoxic DCs into the footpads of mice results in defective DC homing to draining lymph nodes, but enhanced leukocyte recruitment at the site of injection. Thus, hypoxia uncouples the promotion of inflammatory and tissue repair from sentinel functions in DCs, which we suggest is a safeguard mechanism against immune reactivity to damaged tissues.

During the next period we wish to characterize the molecular basis of our observations. In particular, an effort will be made to investigate mechanisms underlying the enhanced inflammatory functions of differentiating DC in hypoxia.

Biochemical and functional studies will be focused on the role of the Hypoxia- Inducible Factor-1 and -2, (HIF-1 and HIF-2) as they represent putative mediators of the adaptive response of DC to hypoxia.""" ;

      dc:description "BACKGROUND: Proteins involved in the aberrant regulation of signaling pathways and their downstream effectors are promising targets for cancer therapy. Survivin is an anti-apoptotic and cell cycle-promoting protein, which is consistently overexpressed in cancer cells. In normal cells, its expression is tightly controlled by signaling pathways and their associated transcriptional activators and repressors. In cancer cells, its expression is enhanced as a consequence of oncogenic signaling. We investigated the potential of a novel, peptide-based survivin inhibitor in breast cancer (SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-468) and glioblastoma (Tu9648) cells. These cells express high levels of survivin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We downregulated survivin expression in tumor cells with a lentiviral gene transfer vector encoding a specific shRNA and a recombinant fusion protein, rSip, comprising the FTH1-derived survivin interaction domain, the human thioredoxin and a protein transduction domain. RESULTS: Downregulation of survivin expression decreased the growth and viability of tumor cells in culture and reduced growth of the cancer cells upon transplantation into immunodeficient mice. rSip selectively targets the anti-apoptotic function of survivin and causes tumor cell death. Non-transformed NIH/3T3 and MCF10A cells remain unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: rSip provides a lead structure for the development of drugs targeting the tumor cell \"addiction protein\" survivin." ;

We have used a known adjuvant, E. coli heat-labile toxin (Etx) and a potential adjuvant R-848, a small TLR7/8 ligand. We have shown that R-848 causes massive changes in DC migration and leads to their activation in lymph nodes but not lymph. These changes are due to TNF-alpha (migration) and Type 1 interferons (activation), but are not accompanied by obvious oral adjuvant effects. In contrast Etx causes only minor changes in migration and activation but is a potent oral adjuvant. Current work is centering on understanding the cellular and molecular bases of these differences and examining other TLR7/8 ligands." ;

      dc:description "Aim:Gefitinib is effective in only approximately 20% of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. FoxM1 is upregulated in NSCLC and associated with a poor prognosis in NSCLC patients. In this study, we examined the possible role of FoxM1 in gefitinib resistance and the related mechanisms.Methods:Gefitinib resistant human lung adenocarcinoma cell line SPC-A-1 and gefitinib-sensitive human lung mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line NCI-H292 were used. mRNA and protein expression of FoxM1 and other factors were tested with quantitative RT PCR and Western blot analysis. RNA interference was performed to suppress FoxM1 expression in SPC-A-1 cells, and lentiviral infection was used to overexpress FoxM1 in H292 cells. MTT assay and flow cytometry were used to examine the proliferation and apoptosis of the cells.Results:Treatment of SPC-A-1 cells with gefitinib (1 and 10 μmol/L) upregulated the expression of FoxM1 in time- and concentration-dependent manners, while gefitinib (1 μmol/L) downregulated in H292 cells. In SPC-A-1 cells treated with gefitinib (1 μmol/L), the expression of several downstream targets of FoxM1, including survivin, cyclin B1, SKP2, PLK1, Aurora B kinase and CDC25B, were significantly upregulated. Overexpression of FoxM1 increased the resistance in H292 cells, while attenuated FoxM1 expression restored the sensitivity to gefitinib in SPC-A-1 cells by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis.Conclusion:The results suggest that FoxM1 plays an important role in the resistance of NSCLC cells to gefitinib in vitro. FoxM1 could be used as a therapeutic target to overcome the resistance to gefitinib." ;

      dc:description "INTRODUCTION: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has a poor outcome, particularly attributed to progressive injury after the initial incident. Several studies suggest a critical role for inflammation in lesion progression after SAH. Our goal was to test whether treatment with anti-inflammatory interferon-β, which has shown promise as a therapeutic agent in experimental ischaemic stroke, can protect the brain after SAH. METHODS: SAH was induced in adult male Wistar rats by puncturing the intracranial bifurcation of the right internal carotid artery. Treatment effects of daily interferon-β (n = 16) or vehicle (n = 14) injections were serially evaluated with multiparametric MRI and behavioral tests from day 0 to 7, in compliance with recent recommendations for pre-clinical drug testing. Outcome measures included neurological status, brain lesion volume, blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage, and levels of inflammatory markers. RESULTS: In animals that survived up to 7 days post-SAH, we found no significant differences between vehicle- and interferon-β-treated animals with respect to final neurological score (14.3 ± 1.0 vs. 13.0 ± 2.2), brain lesion size on T(2)-weighted MR images (59 ± 83 vs. 124 ± 99 mm(3)), BBB leakage (0.26 ± 0.05 vs. 0.22 ± 0.08 contrast-induced relative MR signal change), upregulation of brain RNA for cytokines, chemokines and cell adhesion molecules, and increased neutrophil activation. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previously published findings in experimental ischemic stroke models, interferon-β has no clear efficacy to protect the brain after SAH. In line with recent highlighting of the significance of negative findings, our data currently do not recommend clinical testing of interferon-β to prevent neurological damage in SAH patients." ;

In these studies we used as Ag either Ovalbumin, or rec. Prion-protein. In the latter system, a CD4 T cell response could be initiated. We also found that the DNA sugar backbone determines TLR9 activation. We found that abasic PD 2’ deoxyribose homopolymers act as weak TLR9 agonist and that DNA bases short of CpG-motifs enhance this agonist activity. In contrast phospho-thioate (PS) modified abasic 2’ deoxyribose homopolymers act as TLR9 (and TLR7) agonists, but CpG-motifs convert the antagonistic function into agonist-activity. 

Interestingly, T cell immunity induced was preventive and therapeutic in infectious and tumor models. Since PLGA-MS have a safety history in man, these preclinical vaccination data are promising for use in human.""" ;

In General, the assumption that a physician can keep abreast of the latest developments and scientific knowledge solely by reading the professional literature is unfounded. Although the professional literature is widely available, cutting-edge medicine practiced at a high level of distinction is found only where physicians are involved in vibrant and active research. 

The Hadassah Medical Organization’s perspective embraces a broad view of the needs of the country and the field of medicine. Holding a deep conviction that research is the essence of medicine, Hadassah is committed to advancing and developing the field of medicine in Israel by translating research insights into practical advances that not only prolong but enhance the quality of life. In light of this, Hadassah has set excellence in research as one of the highest of its goals and made research activity its norm. Hadassah is committed to encouraging its physicians to participate in research and to incorporate them into both the Israeli and the international world of research.

Research at Hadassah 

Research at Hadassah hospitals touches every field and area of medicine, be it basic, clinical or applied research. Every department, unit and clinical institute at Hadassah includes a research arm with state-of-the-art laboratories available for the researchers’ use. In addition to those academic researchers at Hadassah for whom research is their main focus, we would like to see every Hadassah physician active in research. A substantial proportion of research at Hadassah is done in cooperation with researchers from the Hebrew University, as well as with researchers from other research institutes in Israel and worldwide. Thus, Hadassah is particularly devoted to openness to interdisciplinary research not only within its schools and departments, but also within its laboratories, institutes and research centers in Israel and abroad. 

Hadassah’s research labs are an inseparable part of the hospital’s clinical departments. In addition, research also takes place in designated research units and in multi-disciplinary research centers, such as the Women’s Health Center, the Gene Therapy Center, the Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, Cancer Immunotherapy and Cell Therapy, the Bone Calcium and Metabolism Research Center, and others. The Ministry of Science recognizes the Gene Therapy Center and Embryonic Stem Cell Center at Hadassah as foundational national centers. These research centers are providing information, help and service to the entire research community in Israel (information on these centers is found in the second chapter of this book).  

In addition to the departmental labs and the multi-disciplinary research centers, our researchers have at their disposal unique basic laboratories, including the cGMP-grade Vector Production Lab; laboratories that meet P3 standards; the Transgenetic Mice Production Unit; the SPF-grade Animal Lab; an Animal MRI Lab, and more.

Hadassah is establishing cooperative centers for the prevention, treatment and research of specific diseases, such as the Diabetes Center, the Lupus Center, the IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) Center, the Cardiovascular Disease Research Center, and others (information on these centers is found in Chapter 3 of this book, under “Information on Various Departments”). These centers, as well, take part in clinical and basic research, each in its own field. 

Funding of research at Hadassah is provided via both internal and external sources. The Hadassah Women’s Zionist Organization of America (HWZOA) has made commitment to research its watchword, and invests heavily in this area. Despite the current financial situation and the deep recession in Israel and worldwide, this year, as well as during the past two previous years, HWZOA have succeeded in continuing to raise funds to finance research. Every year, HWZOA directly distribute Hadassah research funding in the amount of approximately one million dollars – in addition to HWZOA investments in research infrastructure and human resources. Internal research funds are awarded on a competitive basis, with the aim of attracting external competitive funding from Israeli and international sources. In the realm of competitive research, a wide campaign of clinical and applied research is taking place, funded by commercial pharmaceutical and medical equipment companies. A substantial portion of this research originates in the developments that came out of research done at Hadassah.

The high quality of research done at Hadassah can be seen in, among other things, the relatively large number of grants received each year by competitive sources in Israel and worldwide, such as the USA National Institutes of Health, the bi-national funds of Germany, France and USA, the European Union funds, and private funds and organizations.   

Likewise, research excellence is also evidenced in the relatively large number of scientific publications published each year by Hadassah researchers in the leading scientific literature. 

Hadasit Ltd. was founded with the purpose of establishing, supporting and advancing the commercialization of information gained through research done at Hadassah. In the past three years, Hadasit has established twelve technological development subsidiary companies, produced new devices and drugs, and applied for over forty patents created by Hadassah researchers.

Over 200 clinical trials performed each year at the two Hadassah hospitals are facilitated by the Hadasit Company. These clinical trials are part of a series of tests required in the process of authorizing drugs, equipment, methods, or new medical protocols for use in humans. The trials are financed by commercial entities and are used as an important source of data for Evidenced-based Medicine and as a tool for the inculcation of Good Clinical Practices.  (Information on Hadasit can be found in this chapter).

The first chapter of this book presents a selected number of articles and research on various topics, all performed at Hadassah. The second chapter introduces the multi-disciplinary research centers and the national infrastructure found at Hadassah. Finally, the third chapter presents the researchers and a list of their publications in the past three years. The material in this book is organized according to Hadassah divisions and departments. At the end of the book are an index of research topics and an index of researchers. 

The Hadassah Medical Organization’s Division of Research and Development is at your disposal regarding all questions and matters pertaining to researchers and research at Hadassah.""" ;

      dc:description "Blood clotting under hemodynamic conditions involves numerous multiscale interactions from the molecular scale to macroscopic vessel and systemic circulation scales. Transmission of shear forces to platelet receptors such as GPIbα, P-selectin, α(2)β(1), and α(2b)β(3) controls adhesion dynamics. These forces also drive membrane tether formation, cellular deformation, and mechanosignaling in blood cells. Blood flow results in red blood cell (RBC) drift towards the center of the vessel along with a near-wall plasma layer enriched with platelets. RBC motions also dramatically enhance platelet dispersion. Trajectories of individual platelets near a thrombotic deposit dictate capture-activation-arrest dynamics as these newly arriving platelets are exposed to chemical gradients of ADP, thromboxane, and thrombin within a micron-scale boundary layer formed around the deposit. If shear forces are sufficiently elevated (>50 dyne/cm(2)), the largest polymers of von Willebrand Factor may elongate with concomitant shear-induced platelet activation. Finally, thrombin generation enhances platelet recruitment and clot strength via fibrin polymerization. By combination of coarse-graining, continuum, and stochastic algorithms, the numerical simulation of the growth rate, composition, and occlusive/embolic potential of a thrombus now spans multiscale phenomena. These simulations accommodate particular flow geometries, blood phenotype, pharmacological regimen, and reactive surfaces to help predict disease risk or response to therapy." ;

Using a soluble iNKT TCR and a newly engineered antibody specific for alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer)-human CD1d (hCD1d) complexes, we measured the affinity of binding of iNKT TCR to hCD1d molecules loaded with a panel of alpha-GalCer analogues and assessed the rate of dissociation of alpha-GalCer and alpha-GalCer analogues from hCD1d molecules.

      dc:description "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system. The remitting-relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the SJL mouse strain is a common animal model for MS and similar to the human disease it is considered to be T helper cell mediated. Besides interferon-γ secreting T(H) 1 cells in particular the T(H) 17 subset is believed to be highly pathogenic. Spreading of the T(H) 1 and T(H) 17 response to newly emerging determinants has been used to explain clinical disease relapse, but if the magnitude of the T(H) 1/T(H) 17 response is linked to clinical relapse severity has remained unresolved. Here, we assessed clinical EAE severity, the extent of spinal cord histopathology and the magnitude of the antigen-specific T helper cell and autoantibody response in proteolipid protein peptide 139-151 (PLP:139-151)-immunized SJL mice in clinical remission and relapse. We demonstrate that spinal cord histopathology comprised inflammation, demyelination as well as axonal loss and correlated well with clinical disease severity. Although the degree of spinal cord histopathology and clinical severity was separated from the PLP:139-151-specific T(H) 1/T(H) 17 cell and antibody response, it was linked to the number of infiltrating macrophages and activated microglia. In particular, there was a correlation between their secretion product interleukin-1β and the degree of axonal loss. Although CD4(+) T cells seem to be mainly involved in disease initiation, we suggest that it is the downstream activation of the innate immune response that defines the magnitude of the disease outcome. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc." ;

      rdfs:comment """Our lab obtained data on the activation of immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells after transduction with high doses of lentiviral vectors. 

Dendritic cells (DCs) are an attractive tool for immunomodulation, targeting mature DCs (mDCs) for immunization or immature/semimature DCs (iDCs) for tolerization. Therefore, introducing antigens into DCs has become a prime topic in various immunological disciplines. Numerous studies have shown that lentiviruses are an efficient vehicle for this purpose. 

This study evaluates the effects of lentiviral transduction on iDC activation. Immature DCs are efficiently transduced with increasing doses of lentivirus without affecting cell viability. Transduction at low multiplicities of infection (MOIs) did not result in phenotypical or functional maturation. Higher doses of lentivirus, however, resulted in upregulation of adhesion, costimulatory, and HLA molecules, as well as in increased allostimulatory capacity and secretion of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Production of IL-12 p70, IL-10, and interferon-alpha was observed only at extremely high doses. Protein kinase R phosphorylation on transduction at an MOI of 150 was demonstrated by Western blotting. A Toll-like receptor (TLR)-driven luciferase reporter assay showed dose-dependent activation of TLR2, TLR3, and TLR8, which was independent of the pseudotype, production, or transduction protocol and was abrogated on heat inactivation. These data show that lentiviral vectors provide not only the antigen but also appropriate activation signals to iDCs, favoring their use for immunotherapy and vaccine development.""" ;

With around 75 interdisciplinary and practice-orientated courses of study, Leibniz Universität Hannover provides degree and continuing education courses which are orientated both towards demand and quality.

For graduates today, in addition to the academic qualification, it is absolutely essential to think in terms of interdisciplinary, networked systems. The large choice of subjects at Leibniz Universität Hannover permits students to shape their studies individually through a large number of possible combinations.

With the establishment of new courses of study, such as Mechatronics, Nanotechnology, Computer-aided Engineering, Plant Biotechnology or Industrial Engineering, Leibniz Universität Hannover has reacted to the changing demands of the employment market and offers a range of subjects rarely found in Germany.

As far as research is concerned, the University has a marked profile and a series of interdisciplinary focal points. Collaborative research centres, research groups and cooperation programmes with other institutions of higher education and research institutions are proof of this.
The availability of the appropriate specialist literature is also decisive for the quality of teaching and research: with its Technical Library, Hannover has the German Central Library for all fields of technology and their basic sciences, especially Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics and Physics. It is one of the largest specialist libraries in the world for these subjects. The Centre for Applied Linguistics and Special Languages, the Lower Saxony Computer Centre, the Service Center and the Career Service are further facilities which help and support research and study.

Science and industry are also working hand-in-hand. Since 2002 the research centre L3S has been working as a competence centre for innovative learning technology. In the Production Technology Centre at Hannover-Garbsen six institutes of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and well-known industrial partners are carrying out research into demanding production technology. In close cooperation with the Hannover Laser Centre and the Institute of Gravitation Physics at Leibniz Universität Hannover, the Max Planck Society has set up a section as an international centre for gravitational astronomy in order to carry out research into the “big bang”.

Leibniz Universität Hannover: an efficient and modern institution of higher education. Its declared aim is constantly to improve the quality of teaching and research so as to ensure that studying, teaching and researching in Hannover continue to be enjoyable.""" ;

Although much attention has focused on the upstream pathways leading to NF-κB activation, it is now becoming clear that the inhibitor of NF-κB kinases (IKKs), which regulate NF-κB activation, have many independent functions in tissue homeostasis and normal immune function that could compromise the clinical utility of IKK inhibitors. Therefore, if the NF-κB pathway is to be properly exploited as a target for both anticancer and anti-inflammatory drugs, it is appropriate to reconsider the complex roles of the individual NF-κB subunits." ;

      dc:description "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: There exist >78,000 proteins and/or nucleic acids structures that were determined experimentally. Only a small portion of these structures corresponds to those of protein complexes. While homology modeling is able to exploit knowledge-based potentials of side-chain rotomers and backbone motifs to infer structures for new proteins, no such general method exists to extend our understanding of protein interaction motifs to novel protein complexes. RESULTS: We use a Motif Binding Geometries (MBG) approach, to infer a novel protein complex from the database of complexes of homologous proteins taken from other contexts (such as the helix-turn-helix motif binding double stranded DNA), and demonstrate its utility on one of the more important regulatory complexes in biology, that of the RNA polymerase initiating transcription under conditions of phosphate starvation. The modeled PhoB/RNAP/sigma-factor/DNA complex is stereo-chemically reasonable, has sufficient interfacial Solvent Excluded Surface Areas (SESAs) to provide adequate binding strength, is physically meaningful for transcription regulation, and is consistent with a variety of known experimental constraints. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a straightforward and easy to comprehend concept, \"proteins and protein domains that fold similarly could interact similarly\", a structural model of the PhoB dimer in the transcription initiation complex has been developed. This approach could be extended to enable structural modeling and prediction of other bio-molecular complexes. Just as models of individual proteins provide insight into molecular recognition, catalytic mechanism, and substrate specificity, models of protein complexes will provide understanding into the combinatorial rules of cellular regulation and signaling." ;

Human CD83 is a marker molecule for mature dendritic cells (DC) and is also expressed on activated B and T cells. Although CD83 has been implicated in immune responses, its function on DC and T cells remains unclear. 

In this study, we wanted to assess the role of CD83 expressed on DC and T cells in the immune response. Down-regulation of CD83 expression on human DC through RNA interference (RNAi) results in a less potent induction of allogeneic T cell proliferation, reduced IFN-gamma secretion by established T cells and decreased capacity in the priming of functional tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes. In addition, CD83 mRNA-electroporated DC are stronger T cell stimulators. However, CD83 overexpression on Melan-A/MART-1-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) circumvents the need for CD83 expression on DC. Co-culture of immature DC with TIL or K562 cells overexpressing CD83 results in the production of enhanced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas this production is less pronounced or even absent in co-cultures with non-modified TIL or K562 cells. 
In conclusion, we demonstrate that CD83 expression on T cells and DC modulates the immune response by activating DC and by delivering costimulatory signals for the stimulation of naive and memory T cells, respectively.""" ;

Founded in 1817 as a Latin-speaking State University by William I, King of the Netherlands, Ghent University is a relatively young university. After its independence in 1830, the Belgian State was in charge of the administration of Ghent University; French was the new official academic language. In 1930 Ghent University became the first Dutch-speaking university in Belgium. The Decree of 1991 assigned great autonomy to the university.

Over the years eminent scientists such as Joseph Plateau (physicist, considered as a pioneer in the development of motion pictures), Leo Baekeland (inventor of Bakelite) and Corneel Heymans (Nobel Prize winner in Medicine) studied and worked at Ghent University.

With a view to cooperation in research and scientific service, numerous research groups, centres and institutes have been founded over the years. Several of them are renowned worldwide, in various scientific disciplines such as biotechnology, aquaculture, microelectronics, history,...

Today, after decades of uninterrupted growth, Ghent University is one of the leading institutions of higher education and research in the Low Countries. Ghent University is an open, committed and pluralistic university with a broad international perspective.

Located in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium and the cultural and economical heart of Europe, Ghent University is an active partner in national and international educational, scientific and industrial cooperation.

Ghent University's eleven faculties are composed of more than 130 departments all together. These departements offer high-quality courses in every one of their scientific disciplines, each inspired by innovative research.

- Faculty of Arts and Philosophy 
- Faculty of Law 
- Faculty of Sciences 
- Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences 
- Faculty of Engineering 
- Faculty of Economics and Business Administration 
- Faculty of Veterinary Medicine 
- Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences

The maturation state of dendritic cells (DCs) is an important determinant for the initiation and regulation of adaptive immune responses. In this study, we wanted to assess whether functional activation of human monocyte-derived DCs can be achieved by electroporation of an activation signal in the form of double-stranded (ds) RNA and whether simultaneous electroporation of the dsRNA with tumor antigen encoding mRNA can lead to the induction of a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response. Electroporation of immature DCs with poly(I:C(12)U), a dsRNA analogue, resulted in phenotypic as well as functional changes, indicative of DC maturation. Co-electroporation of DCs with both poly(I:C(12)U) and Melan-A/MART-1 encoding mRNA induced strong anti-Melan-A/MART-1 CD8(+) T-cell responses in vitro. Higher numbers of Melan-A/MART-1-specific CTLs were consistently obtained with poly(I:C(12)U)-activated DCs compared to DCs matured in the presence of an inflammatory cytokine cocktail. These results indicate that DC co-electroporation with both dsRNA and tumor antigen encoding mRNA induces fully activated and antigen-loaded DCs that promote antigen-specific CTL responses and may provide the basis for future immunotherapeutic strategies.""" ;

At TWINCORE medical personnel and basic research scientists from various disciplines conduct infection research side by side. Our focus is upon translational research   the interface between basic research and clinical development. 
The goal is to enable the latest findings from basic research to lead to new therapies or diagnostic procedures for patients in the shortest of times. At the same time, basic researchers are looking for answers provided by the clinical work. A further key component of these bridges spanning research and practice is the approval procedures that we are required to complete for clinical applications. Our scientists at TWINCORE support the development of new strategies to combat infectious diseases by creating a scientific basis for risk assessment in advance of the clinical trials.

Around 70 scientists at TWINCORE are currently involved in addressing the following question: what occurs during the course of an infection and what can we do to counteract it? The unique aspect of our establishment is that medical experts, virologists, bacteriologists and immunologists join together in addressing pressing matters regarding infection research. TWINCORE incorporates four TWINCORE  groups and two translational research groups of the Hannover Medical School: 

- Institute for Experimental Infection Research
- Department for Experimental Virology
- Institute for Infection Immunology
- Department for Pathophysiology of Bacterial Biofilms 
- Cell and Gene Therapy Clinical Research Group 
- Infection and Cancer Clinical Research Group 

Our researchers analyse how pathogens and host cells interact with one another and which new mechanisms can inhibit this interaction. They are working on new vaccination strategies that train the immune system in a more specific manner than vaccination methods have been able to thus far. Moreover, in order to research severe illnesses such as hepatitis C our researchers are developing new preclinical model systems - from new cell culture systems to mice with an immune system similar to that of humans.""" ;

The scientific collaboration was extended in 2003 to Université catholique de Louvain (UCL) and to the Brussels branch of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (LICR). The developments are funded in part by the industry partners and by grants from the regional government of Brussels. 

These vaccines are making use of the unique properties of dendritic cells(DCs), a small subpopulation of white blood cells, to activate the sentinels of the immune system (T-lymphocytes). By loading artificially DCs with tumour associated antigens, it is possible to teach the immune system of the patient to destroy its own cancer cells.

The company is currently developing two types of DC vaccines which are both in Phase IIa clinical testing, namely:
DCs fused with whole tumour cells;
DCs loaded ex-vivo with proteins or peptides associated with tumour antigens.

The company also produces and markets a limited number of clinical grade cytokines for use in the preparation of cancer vaccines.""" ;

However, the available data concerning the description of effector and memory CD8+ subsets in humans remain rather fragmentary because different studies favored the usage of distinct and restricted sets of cell surface markers and functional parameters. 

We obtained coexpression data of 18 genes simultaneously in individual cells from CD8+ T cell subsets (associated to multiple markers to subdivide CD8+ T cells into 14 different cell types, several of which were not described previously). Our results show that each subset has a defined pattern of gene expression. Moreover, effector gene expression of CCR7- cells correlated only with CD27 expression levels and CD27/CD28 coexpression but not with CD45RA/R0 phenotypes. Our findings thus describe new CD8+ cell subsets, allow the identification of relatively homogeneous CD8+ subpopulations, provide a predictable and precise correlation between particular cell surface markers and CD8+ T-cell functional properties, and identify effector cells present in both CCR7-CD45RA+ and CCR7-CD45R0+ compartments. The results also indicate that activated cells might modulate the expression of CD45RA/R0 asynchronously rather than CCR7-CD45RA+ cells always issuing from CD45RA- precursors.""" ;

      dc:description "The intraglomerular renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is linked to the pathogenesis of progressive glomerular diseases. Glomerular podocytes and mesangial cells play distinct roles in the metabolism of angiotensin (Ang) peptides. However, our understanding of the RAS enzymatic capacity of glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs) remains incomplete. We explored the mechanisms of endogenous cleavage of Ang substrates in cultured human GEnCs (hGEnCs) using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and isotope-labeled peptide quantification. Overall, hGEnCs metabolized Ang II at a significantly slower rate compared to podocytes, whereas the Ang I processing rate was comparable between glomerular cell types. Ang II was the most abundant fragment of Ang I, with lesser amount of Ang (1-7) detected. Formation of Ang II from Ang I was largely abolished by an Ang converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, whereas Ang (1-7) formation was decreased by a prolylendopeptidase (PEP) inhibitor, but not by a neprilysin inhibitor. Cleavage of Ang II resulted in partial conversion to Ang (1-7), a process that was attenuated by an ACE2 inhibitor, as well as by an inhibitor of PEP and prolylcarboxypeptidase (PCP). Further fragmentation of Ang (1-7) to Ang (1-5) was mediated by ACE. In addition, evidence of aminopeptidase N activity (APN) was demonstrated by detecting amelioration of conversion of Ang III to Ang IV by an APN inhibitor. While we failed to find expression or activity of aminopeptidase A, a modest activity attributable to aspartyl aminopeptidase (DAP) was detected. Messenger RNA and gene expression of the implicated enzymes were confirmed. These results indicate that hGEnCs possess prominent ACE activity, but modest Ang II-metabolizing activity compared to that of podocytes. PEP, ACE2, PCP, APN and DAP are also enzymes contained in hGEnCs that participate in membrane-bound Ang peptide cleavage. Injury to specific cell types within the glomeruli may alter the intrarenal RAS balance." ;

      rdfs:comment """At the end of the 17th century a monarch decided to survey a group of elderly people with the intent of discovering what they considered to be the change that had the most impact on their lives. What the great majority referred were not the wars or the sovereign changes they had witnessed but the introduction of a fireplace in their homes. The fireplace represented an innovation that allowed families to cook and heat their houses without being asphyxiated by the smoke.

More than political occurrences and sports events, people value their welfare, longevity and health. Practically all the changes that contribute to the improvement of our quality of life result from technological innovations that are a direct outcome of advancements obtained at the level of scientific knowledge. But, paradoxically, most people view science as something odd and quite distant from their daily lives - and nothing could be further from the truth! In fact, each new scientific discovery has the potential to invade and change our daily lives - from the food products we choose to the quality of healthcare services available to us. Naming just a few recent examples: satellite communications, cell phones and the Internet, genetically modified foods, genetic testing for hereditary diseases, and new treatments for AIDS and certain types of cancer.

Science and scientists are commonly viewed as belonging to a strange an impenetrable world. Because it is easy to be scared and terrified by something that one does not understand, it is increasingly important to bring scientists closer to society. Only a scientifically informed society can decide, in freedom, about the risks and benefits intrinsic to each innovation offered by scientific and technological progress.

Scientific research and technological development are costly activities. Progress and innovation lack great investments. Traditionally, it is up to governments to finance the pure pursuit of more knowledge, while the private sector primarily invests in projects targeted at developing new products that can be marketed and, therefore, be profitable. But tradition is not what it used to be and, for the sake of progress, the boundaries between fundamental research and applied research are fading away. Nowadays, all great advancements that take place in the majority of scientific areas depend on access to sophisticated technological platforms, in constant development, that derive from applied research projects. On the other hand, it is the knowledge acquired from fundamental research that supplies the necessary foundations for the birth of new applications.

One characteristic intrinsic to fundamental research is its unpredictability. In most cases, the great discoveries that revolutionised scientific knowledge and/or gave rise to important technological innovations, emerged from a research plan that did not, at the outset, foresee the results obtained. The great lesson to be taken from the history of science is that the pursuit of knowledge cannot be prearranged. Thus, it is crucial that investors are made to understand that what is truly important is to support good science and give thematic research freedom to teams of scientists who have proven their excellency and capacity for innovation. Naturally, this concept is extremely difficult to convey to governments and CEO'. For example, in 2000, the President of the United States announced the attribution of 50 million dollars to academic research in the field of prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This governmental decision was a direct result of the extensive media coverage given to the discovery of a potential vaccine against the disease by the researchers of a private company in San Francisco. It is easy to imagine the contempt of the President's advisors at the idea of using this money to study Portuguese Familial Polyneuropathy (a hereditary neurodegenerative disease that affects several families in the North of Portugal). However, it was in the process of studying this rare disease that the Portuguese researcher Maria João Saraiva discovered one of the basic concepts that inspired the experiments for the development of a vaccine against Alzheimer's disease. Quoting Lewis Thomas, \"If you want a bee to make honey, you do not issue protocols on solar navigation or carbohydrate chemistry, you put him together with other bees (and you'd better do this quickly for solitary bees do not stay alive) and you do what you can to arrange the general environment around the hive. If the air is right, the science will come out in its own season, like pure honey\".""" ;

Gene expression was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction following IL-7 stimulation.Results. The percentage of CD4+CD127+ T cells was lower in patients with ICL, compared with controls (P < .001). Lower levels of STAT-5 phosphorylation after IL-7 stimulation were observed in both CD4 and CD8 T cells from patients with ICL, compared with controls (P < .001 and P = .017, respectively), that inversely correlated in CD4 T cells with serum IL-7 levels (r = -0.734, P = .013). Destabilization of p27(kip1), a critical step for IL-7-induced T-cell cycling, was decreased in patients with ICL, compared with controls (P = .004), after IL-7 stimulation.Conclusions. These data suggest that diminished responsiveness to IL-7 in CD4 and CD8 T cells during ICL may be contributing to the dysregulation of T-cell homeostasis." ;

The MAGE genes are selectively expressed in a variety of cancer tissues such as melanoma or gastrointestinal carcinomas. However, no expression is observed in normal tissues except testis. There are several reports on clinical trials with these immunogenic peptides including MAGE gene-derived, which were shown to be effective for some patients with carcinomas. We previously reported a clinical trial treating gastrointestinal carcinoma patients with immature DC and MAGE peptides via intravenous injection. Autologous DCs were generated ex vivo and were pulsed with MAGE-3 peptide, depending on the patient's HLA haplotype (HLA-A02 or A24). In this study, patients were immunized with mature DCs pulsed with the MAGE-3 peptide four times every 2 weeks via s.c. injection close to the axilla and inguinal lymph nodes. Twenty-eight patients with advanced gastrointestinal carcinoma were treated and no toxic side effects were observed. Peptide-specific CTL responses, improvement in performance status, tumor marker decrease and minor tumor regressions after vaccination were observed in some patients. These results suggested that DC vaccination with the MAGE-3 peptide would be safe and can exhibit antitumor effects even in the patients with advanced gastrointestinal carcinoma who were previously treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy." ;

      rdfs:comment """With over 600 years of tradition, the Julius Maximilian University of Würzburg is today one of Germany's mid-sized universities. 400 professors in 10 faculties here teach roughly 20,000 students. 

The University of Würzburg is among the leading institutions of higher education in Germany; this has been confirmed by rankings carried out by national and international research organizations, international external assessment committees as well as by the German Federal and State Excellence Initiatives (founded in 2006). Internationally, the University of Würzburg is also one of the top-ranking academic institutions in many fields of research and study. 

As early as the early 1990s, the university had already begun establishing interdisciplinary research centers, in which new topics of research could be addressed and innovative courses of study created. These interdisciplinary centers have become the international trademark of the University of Würzburg. Numerous external assessment committees confirm this. 

Most recently, the university's priorities have been focused on theInternational Graduate School, established in 2004. The school's intention is to provide all doctoral students structured learning opportunities to accompany their first professional academic pursuits. The University of Würzburg is particularly devoted to supporting the next generation of young academics. 

The creation of new centers has acquired incredible momentum and has established Würzburg as one of the top institutions of higher learning in Germany. Currently, the nine Collaborative Research Centers and nine graduate research training groups are an indication of this momentum. The Collaborative Research Centers and graduate research training groups were established with grants from the German Research Institue (DFG). Underpinning the competitive nature of applying for DFG research grants, Axel Haase, President of the University of Würzburg, remarks: \"the chances of being awarded a DFG grant are generally around 20 percent.\" 

Today, the quality of the scientific research is measured by the number of research projects funded by goverment initiatives, private foundations, and industry. The number of publications in internationally-respected journals like Nature or Science is also a gauge of excellence in research. 

Although the number of professors, assistants, and instructors has remained constant over the past few years, the two parameters of success described above have increased at a nearly explosive rate since the mid-1990s. The foundation of this success was the establishment of new research centers and their integration into the larger structures of the university. """ ;

Dendritic cell biology :  Application to immune-therapy of cancer

Developed a decade ago on mesothelioma cancer, our work had shown that cell death and, in particular, the apoptotic process could initiate immunogenic properties if triggered in a context of cellular stress. Our more recent studies highlighted the induction of one such apoptosis with a favourable immunogenic context either by viral infection (attenuated vaccine of measles virus), or by methylation of DNA and/or the histone de-acethylation via their inhibitor treatments.     
We also showed, in vitro and in vivo, that dendritic cells, after phagocytosis of these apoptotic cells, could initiate an immune response with activation of a specific T  cell response (by presentation and cross-presentation of antigens).  
The aim of our investigation is to propose alternative therapeutics to conventional therapies of pleural mesothelioma, by initiating immunogenic properties of mesothelioma cancer cells after treatments such as :
1) induction of tumor associated antigen expression by specific epigenetic drugs including DNA methylation and histone de-acethylation inhibitors,
2) induction of immunogenic properties of cancer cells viro-infected (measles virus vaccine)
3) induction of an effective cytotoxic immune response via dendritic cells loaded with apoptotic tumor cells.""" ;

The liraglutide therapy improved glycemic control with low hypoglycemia risk and decreased glycated hemoglobin by an average 1,13%. Decreases in systolic pressure and significant body weight loss were observed. Not only did the index describing beta cells function HOMA-B improve but also did the ratio of insulin to proinsulin. Summing up, incretin hormones beneficially influence blood glucose level, moreover, their use decreases blood pressure and body weight which might indicate their positive influence on cardiovascular system in diabetic patients." ;

Enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and Bax activation were essential for HBHA-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by a restoration of the viability of macrophages pretreated with N-acetylcysteine, a potent ROS scavenger, or transfected with Bax siRNA. HBHA is targeted to the mitochondrial compartment of HBHA-treated and M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages. Dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨ(m)) and depletion of cytochrome c also occurred in both macrophages and isolated mitochondria treated with HBHA. Disruption of HBHA gene led to the restoration of ΔΨ(m) impairment in infected macrophages, resulting in reduced apoptosis. Taken together, our data suggest that HBHA may act as a strong pathogenic factor to cause apoptosis of professional phagocytes infected with M. tuberculosis." ;

1) the presence of 2% DMSO in the thawed final vaccine has no negative impact on the quantity and quality of induced immune responses; thus thawed DMSO containing vials do not have to be centrifuged, but simply diluted; 

2) class I peptide loaded cytokine matured DC induce de novo or expand preexisting CD8+ T cell IFN gamma responses in the majority of melanoma patients (>70%), surprisingly without the need for class II peptide loading for T cell help; 

3) a statistical analysis of the whole group of vaccinated melanoma patients showed statistically significant DC induced responses towards the antigens gp100.A2, NY-ESO1.A2, MAGE-3.DR11 and MAGE3.DP4. 

This information will help finalizing the recommendations for vaccine standardization and conduct of DC-trials addressing clinical variables identified in the core discussion group. """ ;

The present study evaluated the effects and mechanisms of pycnidione on the growth and death of A549 human lung cancer cells. Pycnidione significantly inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with a 50% growth inhibition (GI(50)) value of approximately 9.3nM at 48h. Pycnidione significantly decreased the expression of cyclins D1 and E and induced G(1) phase cell cycle arrest and a subsequent increase in the sub-G(1) phase population. Pycnidione also markedly reduced the expression of survivin and activated caspase-8 and -3, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, caused the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and enhanced PAI-1 production, thus triggering apoptosis in the A549 cells. Taken together, pycnidione exerts anti-proliferative effects on human lung cancer cells through the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Therefore, testing of its effects in vivo is warranted to evaluate its potential as a therapeutic agent against lung cancer." ;

To prepare spores, cells are grown on YPD plates, replicated on SPOIV medium (2% potassium acetate, 0.25% yeast extract, 0,1% glucose) and sporulation is assessed by optical microscopy. Zymolyase (2 mg/ml) is used to digest ascum and liberate spores. [We initially performed experiments to evaluate zymoliase sensitivity of asci for this specific strain and we assessed that 15 minutes incubation was the minimum time needed to damage the ascus, without touching the spore cell wall.] Zymoliase is inactivated by heat (65°C for 2 minutes) and washed away carefully together with the remainings of the empty ascus, by resuspending twice the spore culture in 500 µl of distilled water centrifuging and discarding the supernatant; the spores are then resuspended to a concentration of 108 cells/ml. In order to exclude damage on the spore cell wall or effects on spore viability 100 µl of a culture of 1000 spores per ml is plated on YPD in triplicate. [The spores showed 100% viability.] The procedure used allows exposing DCs to the pure spore culture and to analyze the response to the spores alone, eliminating confounding effects of the presence of the ascus. Although from a mycological point of view the term ascospores might seem more appropriate than spores, we will use the term spores to specifically indicate that the effects we are observing are only due to the spores and not to the ascus. 
We observed that after 24 hours of culture in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO-BRL), spores were germinating and the exponentially growing cells were starting to divide. Therefore any analyses performed at later time points would be affected by this altered state, while no interference should be present until 24 hours. """ ;

      dc:description "OBJECTIVE:To test efficacy and safety of atorvastatin in subjects with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). METHODS:Subjects with CIS were enrolled in a phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 14-center randomized trial testing 80 mg atorvastatin on clinical and brain MRI activity. Brain MRIs were performed quarterly. The primary endpoint (PEP) was development of ≥3 new T2 lesions, or one clinical relapse within 12 months. Subjects meeting the PEP were offered additional weekly interferon β-1a (IFNβ-1a). RESULTS:Due to slow recruitment, enrollment was discontinued after 81 of 152 planned subjects with CIS were randomized and initiated study drug. Median (interquartile range) numbers of T2 and gadolinium-enhancing (Gd) lesions were 15.0 (22.0) and 0.0 (0.0) at baseline. A total of 53.1% of atorvastatin recipients (n = 26/49) met PEP compared to 56.3% of placebo recipients (n = 18/32) (p = 0.82). Eleven atorvastatin subjects (22.4%) and 7 placebo subjects (21.9%) met the PEP by clinical criteria. Proportion of subjects who did not develop new T2 lesions up to month 12 or to starting IFNβ-1a was 55.3% in the atorvastatin and 27.6% in the placebo group (p = 0.03). Likelihood of remaining free of new T2 lesions was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group compared with placebo (odds ratio [OR] = 4.34, p = 0.01). Likelihood of remaining free of Gd lesions tended to be higher in the atorvastatin group (OR = 2.72, p = 0.11). Overall, atorvastatin was well tolerated. No clear antagonistic effect of atorvastatin plus IFNβ-1a was observed on MRI measures. CONCLUSION:Atorvastatin treatment significantly decreased development of new brain MRI T2 lesion activity, although it did not achieve the composite clinical and imaging PEP.Classification of Evidence:This study provided Class II evidence that atorvastatin did not reduce the proportion of patients with CIS meeting imaging and clinical criteria for starting immunomodulating therapy after 12 months, compared to placebo. In an analysis of a secondary endpoint (Class III), atorvastatin was associated with a reduced risk for developing new T2 lesions." ;

      dc:description "SARS coronavirus (SCoV) nonstructural protein (nsp) 1, a potent inhibitor of host gene expression, possesses a unique mode of action: it binds to 40S ribosomes to inactivate their translation functions and induces host mRNA degradation. Our previous study demonstrated that nsp1 induces RNA modification near the 5'-end of a reporter mRNA having a short 5' untranslated region and RNA cleavage in the encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosome entry site (IRES) region of a dicistronic RNA template, but not in those IRES elements from hepatitis C or cricket paralysis viruses. By using primarily cell-free, in vitro translation systems, the present study revealed that the nsp1 induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage mainly near the 5' untranslated region of capped mRNA templates. Experiments using dicistronic mRNAs carrying different IRESes showed that nsp1 induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage within the ribosome loading region of type I and type II picornavirus IRES elements, but not that of classical swine fever virus IRES, which is characterized as a hepatitis C virus-like IRES. The nsp1-induced RNA cleavage of template mRNAs exhibited no apparent preference for a specific nucleotide sequence at the RNA cleavage sites. Remarkably, SCoV mRNAs, which have a 5' cap structure and 3' poly A tail like those of typical host mRNAs, were not susceptible to nsp1-mediated RNA cleavage and importantly, the presence of the 5'-end leader sequence protected the SCoV mRNAs from nsp1-induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage. The escape of viral mRNAs from nsp1-induced RNA cleavage may be an important strategy by which the virus circumvents the action of nsp1 leading to the efficient accumulation of viral mRNAs and viral proteins during infection." ;

      dc:description "BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) is not yet well-defined. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the relative effectiveness of treatments in MS, we performed a network of multiple-treatments meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for relapsing MS using three main efficacy outcomes: relapse-free patients, patients without disease progression, and patients without magnetic resonance imaging progression. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify English-language articles with RCTs that compared pharmaceutical treatments using the terms multiple sclerosis and randomized controlled trial. All RCTs that involved patients with definite relapsing MS and provided data for calculating the odds ratios for the main outcomes were considered. First, comparative effectiveness relative to placebo was assessed using direct analysis. Then, each therapy was compared with interferon beta-1b (250 μg)(⁎) in direct and indirect analyses. Effect sizes were estimated by applying a random-effects model. RESULTS: We identified 4165 titles; after screening, 109 articles were eligible for inclusion. In total, 26,828 patients were included. The network consisted of 145 treatments involving 59 direct comparisons with placebo and 8 direct comparisons with interferon beta-1b (250 μg). Two treatments showed better response compared with placebo (direct analysis) for all three efficacy outcomes: natalizumab (300 mg)(†) and fingolimod (0.5 mg). In comparing treatments with interferon beta-1b (250 μg), the network analysis revealed that no therapy shows better response for all 3 efficacy outcomes and alemtuzumab, 12 and 24 mg, have better response for 2 of the outcomes (relapse-free patients and patients without disease progression). CONCLUSIONS: Although some treatments seem to have better efficacy, the results should be interpreted with caution because the network was dominated by indirect comparisons. Data from the selected studies included in the network cannot be extrapolated beyond them. Large RCTs that make head-to-head comparisons between treatments are needed to draw safe conclusions for the optimal treatment of MS." ;

      dc:description "The uptake and long-term cross-presentation of tumor Ag long peptides (LP) by dendritic cells (DC) make them attractive cancer vaccine candidates. However, it remains to be established whether LP can prime long-lived tumor-reactive CTL and whether other cell types are able to cross-present them. Using HLA-A2 healthy donor and melanoma patient-derived PBMC, we studied the in vitro cross-priming potential of Melan-A 16-40 LP bearing the HLA-A2-restricted epitope 26-35 or its analog 26-35(A27L) and compared it to the priming capacity of the short analog. We then addressed LP priming capacity in vivo using HLA-A2 mice. We also studied LP cross-presentation by monocyte-derived DC, plasmacytoid DC, monocytes, and B cells. We showed that the modified LP gave rise to high and sustained cross-presentation by monocyte-derived DC. This led to cross priming in vitro and in vivo and to expansion of long-lived tumor-reactive cytotoxic T cells. In contrast, the LP containing the natural 26-35 epitope primed specific T cells poorly, despite its long-lived cross-presentation, and T cells primed against the short analog were short-lived. We further showed that LP cross-presentation is restricted to monocytes and conventional DC. These results document for the first time, to our knowledge, the strong immunogenicity of a human tumor Ag LP. Of note, they underscore that this property is critically dependent on sufficient HLA binding affinity and/or TCR ligand potency of the cross-presented epitope. We conclude that LP fulfilling this requirement should be used as tumor vaccines, together with DC maturating agents, especially the Melan-A 16-40(A27L) LP, for the treatment of HLA-A2(+) melanoma patients." ;

The \"Bicocca\", as it is commonly known, is a university that strongly believes in the potential of its students and in combining their studies with an active social life.

The University of Milano - Bicocca has twenty-one departments for the scientific areas of Economics, Educational Sciences, Law, Mathematics, Physics and Natural Sciences, Medicine and surgery, Psychology, Sociology, Statistical Sciences.
The departments promote research at the University, and organise the research doctorate programmes.

HISTORY
The University of Milano—Bicocca turned 10 in 2008 but our history is richer than it seems. It was instituted on June 10th, 1998 to serve students from Northern Italy and take some pressure off the historical University of Milan which was getting over-crowded. At that time we did not have an officially nominated teaching staff. Groups of professors and researchers from the same scientific fields chose to come and participate in the project. They were driven by their enthusiasm for the new, and by the chance to broaden academic horizons without having their work undermined by traditional education methods. From the start, this very fertile climate became a unique training ground, which offered something new, even for the most traditional disciplines.

The University stands in an area on the northern outskirts of Milan that up until the late eighties was occupied by the Pirelli tyre industrial complex and is now the product of the biggest urban renewal project ever carried out in Milan since the end of the Second World War. Based on a design by the world-renowned ‘Gregotti Associati International’ design and architectural firm,  the ex industrial area and its warehouses were quickly converted into a new district, which includes our Athenaeum, research laboratories and student residence halls, the Arcimboldi Theatre,  temporary location of the La Scala theatre during its renewal tenure, the state National Research Council (CNR), multinational company offices and the new headquarters of the Pirelli Group, new homes and sports centres, showrooms, a large multi-screen cinema, and a park with the ‘Collina dei ciliegi’ (cherry-tree hill). 

In this cityscape the University of Milano—Bicocca was born and hundreds of lecturers have brought their competences, international networks and research groups. This synergy makes the University a laboratory where tradition and modernity are fused to invent an innovative visionary future. 

But why Bicocca?  The new quarter is named after the ancient villa Bicocca degli Arcimboldi (located at # 202, viale Sarca),  a mid-15th century rural residence of the Arcimboldi family, which now belongs to a financial holding company. In the heart of the Bicocca quarter, University buildings are characterized by red walls and white window shutters: the main complex facing the squares Piazza dell’Ateneo Nuovo and Piazza della Scienza is made of two pre-existing Pirelli warehouses.""" ;

Our university offers a wide spectrum of subjects, the diversity and interdisciplinary integration of which is unique in Germany. We see this \"integrated diversity\" as the key feature that enables us to enhance our profile in research and teaching while at the same time promoting the process of internationalisation more intensively. 

In addition to giving guidance in the pursuit of academic study, excellence in academic teaching requires us to develop new and innovative courses of study with an international orientation which will qualify our students to face the professional challenges of the future. Our career-focussed orientation is based on close co-operation with influential partners in industry, finance and politics providing a network of steadfast support through international exchange and individual contributions. A further priority in this respect is our commitment to maintaining ties with our alumni. 

Today, new knowledge is increasingly the result of interdisciplinary research which is no longer neatly compartmentalised within the traditional limits of academic subjects. Thanks to the breadth of our subject range, our university offers an ideal environment in which to generate this type of innovative research. This has enabled the university to secure a leading place among the German universities in the German Research Foundation (DFG) rankings and to attract a large number of Humboldt scholars, who have chosen our university as the place to pursue their research.

Glucose responsive biotransducers were prepared by potentiostatic electropolymerization [750 mV vs. Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl)] of pyrrole at Poly(hydoxyethyl methacrylate)-based hydrogel-coated Pt micro-electrodes (Φ = 100 μm) from aqueous solutions of pyrrole and glucose oxidase (GOx; 0.4 M pyrrole, 1.0 mg/ml GOx) to 1.0 and 10.0 mC/cm². Polypyrrole was them over-oxidized by cyclic voltammetry (0-1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, 40 cycles in PBKCl, pH = 7.0). Biotransducers were stored at 4 °C in PBKCl for up to 18 days. Amperometric dose-response at 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl followed by Lineweaver-Burk analysis produced enzyme kinetic parameters as a function of electropolymerization charge density and storage time. Apparent Michaelis constant (K (Mapp)) increased from 18.6-152.0 mM (1.0 mC/cm²) and from 2.7-6.1 mM (10.0 mC/cm²). Biotransducer sensitivity increased to 21.2 nA/mM after 18 days and to 12.8 pA/mM after 10 days for the 1.0 and 10.0 mC/cm² membranes, respectively. Maximum current, I (max), also increased over time to 2.7 nA (1.0 mC/cm²) and to 170 pA (10.0 mC/cm²). Electropolymerization of polypyrrole is shown to be an effective means for imparting bioactivity to a hydrogel-coated microelectrode. GOx was shown to be stabilized and to increase activity over time within the electroconductive hydrogel." ;

      dc:description "Dopamine (DA) agonists are widely used as primary treatments for Parkinson's disease. However, they do not prevent progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, the central pathology of the disease. In this study, we found that subcutaneous injection of a cytokine mixture containing granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-3 (IL-3) markedly suppressed dopaminergic neurodegeneration in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats, an animal model of Parkinson's disease. The cytokine mixture suppressed the decrease of DA content in the striatum, and ameliorated motor function in the lesioned rats. In response to the cytokine injection, dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta increased expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL. Microglial activation in the pars compacta was evident in both the saline- and cytokine-injected rats. However, the cytokine mixture suppressed expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and tumor necrosis factors α, and upregulated the neuroprotective factors insulin-like growth factor-1 and hepatocyte growth factor. Similar responses were observed in cultured microglia. Detailed morphometric analyses revealed that NG2 proteoglycan-expressing glial cells increased in the cytokine-injected rats, while astrocytic activation with increased expression of antioxidative factors was evident only in the saline-injected rats. Thus, the present findings show that the cytokine mixture was markedly effective in suppressing neurodegeneration. Its neuroprotective effects may be mediated by increased expression of Bcl-xL in dopaminergic neurons, and the activation of beneficial actions of microglia that promote neuronal survival. Furthermore, this cytokine mixture may have indirect actions on NG2 proteoglycan-expressing glia, whose role may be implicated in neuronal survival." ;

Our pipeline of cancer product candidates is built on first-in-class oncolytic virus technology that replicates and spreads within solid tumors, causing the death of cancer cells, accompanied by the induction of a systemic immune response. We believe that this technology, \"OncoVEX\", is more effective than earlier-generation oncolytic viruses and has the potential to establish a new standard of care in the treatment of solid tumors, while minimizing side effects. 

OncoVEXGM-CSF is completing a 50-patient Phase II clinical trial in the United States for the treatment of unresectable metastatic melanoma, as a monotherapy, in the second line/salvage therapy setting. Data so far indicates that OncoVEX can destroy both injected and un-injected melanoma deposits. Pivotal studies, intended for registration, are currently being planned. 

Additional studies with OncoVEXGM-CSF are ongoing in head & neck cancer and pancreatic cancer. 

Our lead infectious disease product candidate is ImmunoVEXHSV2 , a vaccine for genital herpes. At least 45 million people over the age of 11 in the United States have been infected with HSV-2, the cause of genital herpes. However, even though a number of HSV-2 vaccine candidates have previously been developed, none has proved broadly effective. ImmunoVEXHSV2 is a novel live-attenuated vaccine candidate that expresses approximately 80 HSV-2 proteins intended to stimulate a broad and powerful immune response. In preclinical studies, ImmunoVEXHSV2 completely prevents disease and invokes a powerful immune response, indicating that ImmunoVEX HSV2 is more potent than other HSV-2 vaccines for which published data are available. We intend to initiate a Phase I clinical trial for this product early in 2008.""" ;

      dc:description "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Many eukaryotic genomes encode cis-natural antisense transcripts (cis-NATs). Sense and antisense transcripts may form double-stranded RNAs that are processed by the RNAi machinery into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). A few so-called nat-siRNAs have been reported in plants, mammals, Drosophila, and yeasts. However, many questions remain regarding the features and biogenesis of nat-siRNAs. RESULTS: Through deep sequencing, we identified more than 17,000 unique siRNAs corresponding to cis-NATs from biotic and abiotic stress-challenged Arabidopsis thaliana and 56,000 from abiotic stress-treated rice. These siRNAs were enriched in the overlapping regions of NATs and exhibited either site-specific or distributed patterns, often with strand bias. Out of 1,439 and 767 cis-NAT pairs identified in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively, 84 and 119 could generate at least 10 siRNAs per million reads from the overlapping regions. Among them, 16 cis-NAT pairs from Arabidopsis and 34 from rice gave rise to nat-siRNAs exclusively in the overlap regions. Genetic analysis showed that the overlapping double-stranded RNAs could be processed by Dicer-like 1 (DCL1) and/or DCL3. The DCL3-dependent nat-siRNAs were also dependent on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR2) and plant-specific RNA Polymerase IV (PolIV), whereas only a fraction of DCL1- dependent nat-siRNAs was RDR- and PolIV-dependent. Furthermore, the levels of some nat-siRNAs were regulated by specific biotic or abiotic stress conditions in Arabidopsis and rice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that nat-siRNAs display distinct distribution patterns and are generated by DCL1 and/or DCL3. Our analysis further supported the existence of nat-siRNAs in plants and advanced our understanding of their characteristics." ;

      dc:description "The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) glycoprotein family, also referred to as human leukocyte antigens, present endogenous and exogenous antigens to T lymphocytes for recognition and response. These molecules play a central role in enabling the immune system to distinguish self from non-self, which is the basis for protective immunity against pathogenic infections and disease while at the same time representing a serious obstacle for tissue transplantation. All known MHC family members, like the majority of secreted, cell surface, and other immune-related molecules, carry asparagine (N)-linked glycans. The immune system has evolved increasing complexity in higher-order organisms along with a more complex pattern of protein glycosylation, a relationship that may contribute to immune function beyond the early protein quality control events in the endoplasmic reticulum that are commonly known. The broad MHC family maintains peptide sequence motifs for glycosylation at sites that are highly conserved across evolution, suggesting importance, yet functional roles for these glycans remain largely elusive. In this review, we will summarize what is known about MHC glycosylation and provide new insight for additional functional roles for this glycoprotein modification in mediating immune responses." ;

      dc:description "Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is an allosterically regulated enzyme with transamidating, deamidating and cell signaling activities. It is thought to catalyze sequence-specific deamidation of dietary gluten peptides in the small intestines of celiac disease patients. Because this modification has profound consequences for disease pathogenesis, there is considerable interest in the design of small molecule TG2 inhibitors. Although many classes of TG2 inhibitors have been reported, thus far an animal model for screening them to identify promising celiac drug candidates has remained elusive. Using intraperitoneal administration of the toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) ligand, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I∶C)), we induced rapid TG2 activation in the mouse small intestine. Dose dependence was observed in the activation of TG2 as well as the associated villous atrophy, gross clinical response, and rise in serum concentration of the IL-15/IL-15R complex. TG2 activity was most pronounced in the upper small intestine. No evidence of TG2 activation was observed in the lung mucosa, nor were TLR7/8 ligands able to elicit an analogous response. Introduction of ERW1041E, a small molecule TG2 inhibitor, in this mouse model resulted in TG2 inhibition in the small intestine. TG2 inhibition had no effect on villous atrophy, suggesting that activation of this enzyme is a consequence, rather than a cause, of poly(I∶C) induced enteropathy. Consistent with this finding, administration of poly(I∶C) to TG2 knockout mice also induced villous atrophy. Our findings pave the way for pharmacological evaluation of small molecule TG2 inhibitors as drug candidates for celiac disease." ;

      dc:description "Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder with predilection for the axial skeleton, leading to progressive restricted mobility and deformity of the spine. The fundamental mechanism involves autoimmunity orchestrated by T cells. Similar to other rheumatic diseases, the complex interplay of cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6 (IL 6) and interleukin-10 (IL 10) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. Despite extensive research over the past decades, the treatment options for AS, are limited. Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first line of therapy, whereas anti TNF drugs are administered for refractory cases which fail to respond to the treatment. There have been conflicting views on the correlation of IL 6 with disease activity in AS. As such, the debate on the role of anti IL6 in AS is still ongoing. Anti IL 6 such as tocilizumab and siltuximab have proven efficacy based on the large randomized controlled trials. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved these drugs for treating rheumatoid arthritis and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Researchers have adventurously experimented anti IL 6 therapy in AS but the conclusions made were not consolidated into international guidelines or consensus statement for clinical practice. In the present review, we explore the role of anti IL6 in the treatment of AS based on the cumulative evidence over recent years." ;

      dc:description "BACKGROUND: Sensitization to protease allergens, such as papain, or helminth infection is associated with basophil recruitment to draining lymph nodes (LNs). Basophils have the capacity to present antigen to naive T cells and promote T(H)2 differentiation directly or indirectly through IL-4 production. OBJECTIVE: We studied how papain induces basophil migration to LNs and the contribution of various leukocytes to papain-induced immune responses. METHODS: We immunized mice in the footpad with papain and studied leukocyte recruitment and inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production in the draining popliteal LNs. RESULTS: Papain directly activated naive T cells through protease-activated receptor (PAR) 2 to initiate a chemokine/cytokine program that includes CCL17, CCL22, and IL-4. Papain-triggered innate immune responses were dependent on both CD4 T cells and PAR2 and were strongly reduced in the absence of CCR4, the primary receptor for CCL17/CCL22. CONCLUSION: These results elucidate a novel innate allergen-recognition pathway mediated by naive T cells through PAR2, which provide an immediate source of chemokines and IL-4 upstream of basophils and antigen-restricted T(H)2 differentiation. PAR2 antagonism might thus hold promise for the treatment of allergic disease." ;

      rdfs:comment """A brief history of the University

As the oldest university in the English-speaking world, Oxford is a unique and historic institution. There is no clear date of foundation, but teaching existed at Oxford in some form in 1096 and developed rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris.

In 1188, the historian, Gerald of Wales, gave a public reading to the assembled Oxford dons and in 1190 the arrival of Emo of Friesland, the first known overseas student, set in motion the University's tradition of international scholarly links. By 1201, the University was headed by a magister scolarum Oxonie, on whom the title of Chancellor was conferred in 1214, and in 1231 the masters were recognized as a universitas or corporation.

In the 13th century, rioting between town and gown (townspeople and students) hastened the establishment of primitive halls of residence. These were succeeded by the first of Oxford's colleges, which began as medieval 'halls of residence' or endowed houses under the supervision of a Master. University, Balliol and Merton Colleges, which were established between 1249 and 1264, are the oldest.

Less than a century later, Oxford had achieved eminence above every other seat of learning, and won the praises of popes, kings and sages by virtue of its antiquity, curriculum, doctrine and privileges. In 1355, Edward III paid tribute to the University for its invaluable contribution to learning; he also commented on the services rendered to the state by distinguished Oxford graduates.

From its early days, Oxford was a centre for lively controversy, with scholars involved in religious and political disputes. John Wyclif, a 14th-century Master of Balliol, campaigned for a bible in the vernacular, against the wishes of the papacy. In 1530, Henry VIII forced the University to accept his divorce from Catherine of Aragon, and during the Reformation in the 16th century, the Anglican churchmen Cranmer, Latimer and Ridley were tried for heresy and burnt at the stake in Oxford.

The University was Royalist in the Civil War, and Charles I held a counter-Parliament in Convocation House, and in the late 17th century, the Oxford philosopher John Locke, suspected of treason, was forced to flee the country.

The 18th century, when Oxford was said to have forsaken port for politics, was also an era of scientific discovery and religious revival. Edmund Halley, Professor of Geometry, predicted the return of the comet that bears his name; John and Charles Wesley's prayer meetings laid the foundations of the Methodist Society.

The University assumed a leading role in the Victorian era, especially in religious controversy. From 1833 onwards The Oxford Movement sought to revitalise the Catholic aspects of the Anglican Church. One of its leaders, John Henry Newman, became a Roman Catholic in 1845 and was later made a Cardinal. In 1860 the new University Museum was the scene of a famous debate between Thomas Huxley, champion of evolution, and Bishop Wilberforce.

From 1878, academic halls were established for women and they were admitted to full membership of the University in 1920. Since 1974, all but one of Oxford's 38 colleges has changed their statutes to admit both men and women. St Hilda's remains the only women's college, though it will admit both women and men from October 2008.

During the 20th and early 21st centuries, Oxford added to its humanistic core a major new research capacity in the natural and applied sciences, including medicine. In so doing, it has enhanced and strengthened its traditional role as an international focus for learning and a forum for intellectual debate.""" ;

      dc:description "In Denmark the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) has increased over the past 30 years, and it is presumed that the incidence of neglected NMSC will increase. Neglected NMSC is frequently seen in patients with psychosocial disabilities. If treatment is delayed consequences regarding treatment options and prognosis can be severe. We describe two cases of patients with psychosocial disabilities and neglected NMSC. In conclusion physicians, who treat patients with psychosocial disabilities and NMSCs, should be aware of the risk of neglect and ensure that treatment is complied." ;

      dc:description "In the prefrontal cortex, dopamine D(1)-like and M(1) muscarinic receptors are both involved in the regulation of attentional, cognitive and emotional processes but so far no information has been provided on their functional interaction. In the present study we show that in mouse medial prefrontal cortex, concomitant activation of M(1) muscarinic receptors potentiated D(1)-like receptor-induced cyclic AMP formation through a mechanism involving activation of G(q/11) and the release of G protein βγ subunits. Immunohistochemical studies indicated that the adenylyl cyclase isoforms AC2 and AC4 are expressed in mouse prefrontal cortex and that they colocalize with D(1)-like receptors with a greater association for AC4. In primary cultures of frontal cortex neurons, D(1)-like receptor-induced Ser133 phosphorylation of the transcription factor cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) was potentiated by concurrent stimulation of M(1) receptors. Suppression of AC4 expression with small interfering RNA transfection reduced D(1) stimulation of cyclic AMP formation and CREB phosphorylation and abolished the M(1) potentiation, whereas knockdown of AC2 had no significant effects. These data indicate that in mouse prefrontal cortex G(q/11)-coupled M(1) receptor and G(s)-coupled D(1)-like receptor inputs converge on AC4 with a consequent enhancement of cyclic AMP formation and signaling to the nucleus." ;

We have reported that plasmacytoid precursor dendritic cells (pDC) activated with the TLR-9 ligand CpG induce strong development of Th1 responses (Boonstra et al, 2003). In contrast, bone marrow-derived myeloid DC (BM-myeloid DC) and splenic CD8alpha+ and CD8alpha- DC, despite expression of TLR9 mRNA, were poor at directing Th1 responses when activated with CpG. 

We have determined mechanisms for DC-induced Th1 development and the molecular pathways for inducing Th1 cells producing IFN-gamma solely, or Th1 cells producing IFN-gamma and IL-10, which have important implications for regulation of the immune response to eradicate pathogens with minimum pathology. This manuscript is now submitted for publication (Saraiva, O’Garra et al, 2007 – under review for Immunity). We have already determined that GATA-3 remodels the IL-10 locus specifically in T cells (Shoemaker et al, 2006) but are now also showing that in the absence of GATA-3 other signalling pathways and transcription factors may lead to induction of IL-10.""" ;

The city of Brussels is the capital of a federal state which has three different administrative regions based on language and has been at the heart of Europe since 1957. It naturally follows that the city should have a university in keeping with its standing and the ULB, with its 20,000 students, 27% of whom come from abroad, and its very cosmopolitan body of staff, is an intrinsically international institution open to both Europe and to the whole world.

It was at the heart of the creation of a network of major universities from different European capitals – UNICA – and is involved in international programmes for research and development and for mobility.

The ULB is a multicultural institution which has 7 faculties and a range of schools and institutes and is, at the same time, a comprehensive university providing academic tuition in all disciplines and study cycles.

With its three Nobel Prize winners, a Fields medal, a Wolf Prize for physics, two Marie Curie Prizes and 29% of the Francqui prizes awarded, the university is also a major research centre which is recognised by the academic community the world over.

Nor does it shirk its social, societal and scientific commitments, which it meets through combining broad access to higher education with excellent quality research and through

its role in furthering economic development in the regions where it is located (Brussels and Wallonia). The ULB also has a teaching hospital – the Hôpital Erasme, a specialist institute for studying cancer – the Institut Bordet, and an extensive hospital network. 

For about a decade now the university has been actively involved in maximising research potential in both Brussels and Charleroi, where it has set up a biotechnology pole around its renowned Institute for Biology and Molecular Medicine (IBMM) and Institute of Medical Immunology( IMI)

In terms of partnerships, it is part of the Wallonia-Brussels Academy, together with the Mons-Hainaut University and the Mons Polytechnic Faculty and, in conjunction with 5 hautes écoles, the royal military school, 2 institutes for architectural studies and 2 colleges for fine arts, it also makes up the Brussels-Wallonia European University Pole.

As a private university, which is recognised and subsidised by the Belgian authorities, the ULB receives government funding today to the tune of 60% of its overall budget.

Founded on the principle of free-thinking analysis which advocates independent reasoning and the rejection of dogma in all its forms, the ULB has remained true to its original ideals – an institution free from any form of control which is committed to defending democratic humanist values, an approach it also extends to the way that it is run.""" ;

      dc:description "Cellular and molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) strategies for studying the spatiotemporal profile of neuroinflammatory processes after stroke are increasingly being explored since the first reports appeared about a decade ago. These strategies most often employ (super)paramagnetic contrast agents, such as (ultra)small particles of iron oxide and gadolinium chelates, for MRI-based detection of specific leukocyte populations or molecular inflammatory markers that are involved in the pathophysiology of stroke or plasticity. In this review we describe achievements, limitations and prospects in the field of cellular and molecular MRI of neuroinflammation in preclinical and clinical stroke. Several studies in rodent stroke models have demonstrated the application of MRI contrast agents for imaging of monocyte infiltration, which served as the foundation for pilot (small-scale proof-of-concept) cellular MRI studies in stroke patients. This may be achieved with isolated cells that are loaded with contrast agent through in vitro incubation prior to systemic administration. Alternatively, superparamagnetic iron oxide particles may be directly injected into the circulation to allow in vivo uptake by phagocytic cells. Both strategies have been successfully employed to measure the spatiotemporal profile of invasion of monocytes in and around cerebral ischemic lesions in experimental stroke models. Molecular MRI studies with target-specific contrast agents have shown the capability for in vivo detection of molecular markers after experimental stroke. For example, (super)paramagnetic micro- or nanoparticles that are functionalized with a ligand (e.g. an antibody) for specific cell adhesion molecules, such as E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), can target inflamed, activated endothelium, whose presence can subsequently be detected with MRI. Present applications remain limited as most of the currently available contrast agents provide relatively poor contrast enhancement, which is not easily discriminated from endogenous sources of tissue contrast. Nevertheless, current developments of more efficient particles, such as biocompatible liposomes, micelles and nanoemulsions that can contain high payloads of (super)paramagnetic material as well as other substances, such as dyes and drugs, may open a window of opportunities for promising translational multimodal imaging strategies that enable in vivo assessment of (neuroinflammatory) disease markers, therapeutic targets as well as drug delivery after stroke." ;

      dc:description "Most gastric cancer cells are resistant to tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Since TRAIL resistance is associated with lipid rafts, in which both death receptors and epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) are enriched, our aim is to identify how lipid raft-regulated receptor redistribution influences the sensitivity of TRAIL in gastric cancer cells. In TRAIL-resistant gastric cancer cells, TRAIL did not induce effective death-inducing signalling complex (DISC) formation in lipid rafts, accompanied with EGFR translocation into lipid rafts, and activation of EGFR pathway. Knockdown of casitas B-lineage lymphoma-b (Cbl-b) enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis by promoting DISC formation in lipid rafts. However, knockdown of Cbl-b also enhanced EGFR translocation into lipid rafts and EGFR pathway activation induced by TRAIL. Either using inhibitors of EGFR or depletion of EGFR with small interfering RNA (siRNA) prevented EGFR pathway activation, and thus increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis, especially in Cbl-b knockdown clones. Taken together, TRAIL-induced EGFR activation through Cbl-b-regulated EGFR redistribution in lipid rafts antagonised TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The contribution of DISC formation and the inhibition of EGFR signal triggered in lipid rafts are both essential for increasing the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to TRAIL." ;

We have shown that plasmacytoid pDC respond to both CpG and the TLR-7 ligand R848 to produce very high levels of IL-12p70 (in the ng/ml range per 5 x 105 cells/ml) and IFN-gamma. However, BM-myeloid and splenic CD8alpha+ DC  produced at least fivefold less IL-12p70, and CD8alpha- DC produced undetectable levels of IL-12p70 upon stimulation with CpG. 

We show that induction of endogenous IL-10 production by these latter DC subsets accounts for their low levels of IL-12p70 production, and since the plasmacytoid pDC do not produce IL-10 this explains their production of high levels of IL-12p70.  Neither endogenous IL-10 production nor a lack of TLR9 expression can however explain the lack of IFN-alpha production by the myeloid and splenic CD8alpha+ and CD8alpha- DC. These data suggest that different pathogens may trigger differential cytokine production as a result of their engagement of distinct TLRs on DC, and in addition by their differential ability to induce IL-10 or IFN-alpha in different DC. This work has now been published in the J. Immunology (Boonstra, Rajsbaum et al, 2006) and the microarray studies as discussed above are based on this study but including the plasmacytoid DC and will continue this project in collaboration with P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli, UNIMIB.""" ;

Microbial invasions are perceived by pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-expressing cells of the innate immune system. PRRs bind a number of microbial products collectively referred to as microorganism-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the best-characterized PRRs. The interaction of MAMPs with TLRs expressed on dendritic cells (DCs) plays a particularly important role in regulation of immune responses. By interacting with different combinations of adapter proteins, individual TLRs turn on signal transduction pathways leading to the activation of different transcription factors, such as nuclear factor (NF)-kB, activation protein (AP)-1, and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs).

      dc:description "In response to inflammatory stimulation, dendritic cells (DCs) have a remarkable pattern of differentiation that exhibits specific mechanisms to control the immune response. Here we show that in response to polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid (pI:C), DCs mount a specific integrated stress response during which the transcription factor ATF4 and the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34/Ppp1r15a), a phosphatase 1 (PP1) cofactor, are expressed. In agreement with increased GADD34 levels, an extensive dephosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α was observed during DC activation. Unexpectedly, although DCs display an unusual resistance to protein synthesis inhibition induced in response to cytosolic dsRNA, GADD34 expression did not have a major impact on protein synthesis. GADD34, however, was shown to be required for normal cytokine production both in vitro and in vivo. These observations have important implications in linking further pathogen detection with the integrated stress response pathways." ;

The monocytes were cultured for five days to immature DC (imDC´s) and subsequently transfected with different constructs encoding for the oncogene Her-2/neu and as control PSA using the technology of Amaxa biosystems or an adeno virus Her-2 full length construct. Levels of Her-2 expression was highest following transfection with  3 different truncated Transmembrane-extracellular constructs, in particular a Her-2 rat-human chimeric one, while a full-length mutant Her-2 construct resulted in relatively low expression. Transfection with the adeno-Her-2 construct resulted in a very high expression level (80% positive cells) of Her-2 in combination with high cell viability (90%),  which was in contrast to the relatively low expression observed with the same Her-2 construct as a pDNA construct transfected with the Amaxa based electroporation. We have concluded that when optimized the combination of leukapheresis and elutriation technologies, creates flexible platforms yielding large scale clinical grade enrichment of monocytes with high purity usefull for transfection with Her-2 or other cancer related gene products for DC based cell therapy and vaccination." ;

      dc:description "PURPOSE: An intact immune system likely contributes to the outcome of treatment, and may be important for clearance of drug-resistant tumor cells and for prevention of recurrence. While pharmacologic inhibition of BRAF(V600E) in melanoma patients, which is linked to immune suppression, results in an initial response rate, these responses are typically of limited duration. Combining immunotherapeutic drugs with kinase-targeted agents is an attractive strategy to increase clinical efficacy. Evidence suggesting that MAPK pathway activation in tumor cells contributes to immune suppression, suggests that the two approaches may be synergistic, provided that BRAF(V600E) inhibitors are nontoxic to immune cells. METHODS: To assess effects of mutant BRAF inhibition on systemic immunity, we studied 13 patients with tumors carrying a BRAF mutation who underwent treatment with GSK2118436, a V600 mutant BRAF-specific inhibitor. We performed peripheral blood immunomonitoring prior to and following one or two 28-day cycles of treatment. RESULTS: GSK2118436 treatment had no detectable impact on most immune parameters tested, including serum cytokine levels, peripheral blood cell counts, leukocyte subset frequencies, and memory CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell recall responses. A slight increase in serum TNF-alpha over the course of treatment was observed. In addition, three of the four HLA-A2-positive patients experienced a modest increase in circulating tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells following BRAF(V600) inhibitor therapy. CONCLUSIONS: GSK2118436 treatment results in no detectable negative impact on existing systemic immunity or the de novo generation of tumor-specific T-cells. These findings suggest that future trials combining specific BRAF(V600E) inhibition with immunotherapy should not impair immune response." ;

On the one hand we compared lipofection of tumor-antigen-encoding RNA to RNA electroporation into DC, and found that electroporation results in antigen expression in all cells, while lipofection results in higher antigen expression only in a portion of the cells (other cells are negative). Interestingly, the priming capacity of MelanA/HLA-A2-specific autologous CD8+ T cells by lipofected DC was higher compared to electroprated DC. On the other hand, we compared RNA electroporation to loading of DC with anti-DEC205-antigen constructs, consisting of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) directed against DEC-205, genetically linked to different parts of the MAGE-A3 model antigen (i.e. the KKl  and EVDPIGHLY peptides). To quantify presentation of the epitopes by DC, we used bulk T cells electroporated with TCR-encoding RNA in stimulation assays. Cytokine production by these T cells was used as a read-out.  

First experiments showed that loading of DC  with the anti-DEC-205scFv-MAGE-A3-KKL construct led to antigen presentation, whereas heat-inactivated constructs or control constructs did not.""" ;

      dc:description "Background:In uveal melanoma (UM), the most frequent primary intraocular tumour in adults, loss of one entire chromosome 3 (monosomy 3 (M3)) is observed in ∼50% of tumours and is significantly associated with metastatic disease. The strong association of metastatic disease with M3 offers the opportunity for molecular prognostic testing of UM patients.Methods:To re-evaluate M3 as prognostic marker in our clinical and laboratory setting and to determine the metastatic potential of rare tumours with partial M3, we performed a comprehensive study on 374 UM patients treated by enucleation in our clinic within 10 consecutive years, starting in 1998. Genotyping of all tumours was performed by microsatellite analysis.Results:Median follow-up time was 5.2 years. The disease-specific mortality rates (death by UM metastases) for tumours with disomy 3 (D3) and M3 were 13.2% and 75.1%, respectively. The disease-specific survival was worse when M3 was observed together with chromosome 8 alterations (P=0.020). Death of UM metastases was also observed in 12 patients (9%) with D3 tumours. The metastasising D3 tumours showed a larger basal tumour diameter (P=0.007), and were more frequently of mixed or epitheloid cell type (P<0.0001) than D3 tumours that did not metastasise. Mortality rate of tumours showing partial M3 (8.3%) was as low as that for tumours with D3.Conclusion:This shows that large tumours with disomy 3 have an increased risk to develop metastases. On the basis of these results, our clinic offers routine prognostic testing of UM patients by chromosome 3 typing." ;

We have previously demonstrated that a γ(1)34.5-deleted HSV-1 expressing murine interleukin-12 (M002) prolonged survival of immunocompetent mice in intracranial models of brain tumors. We hypothesized that M002 would be suitable for use in clinical trials for patients with malignant glioma. To test this hypothesis, we: 1) compared the efficacy of M002 to three other HSV-1 mutants, R3659, R8306 and G207, in murine models of brain tumors; 2) examined the safety and biodistribution of M002 in the HSV-1 sensitive primate Aotus nancymae following intracerebral inoculation; and 3) determined whether murine IL-12 produced by M002 was capable of activating primate lymphocytes. Results are summarized as follows: 1) M002 demonstrated superior anti-tumor activity in two different murine brain tumor models as compared to three other genetically engineered HSV-1 mutants; 2) no significant clinical or MRI evidence of toxicity was observed following direct inoculation of M002 into the right frontal lobes of A. nancymae; 3) there was no histopathologic evidence of disease in the A. nancymae one month or 5.5 years following direct inoculation and 4) murine IL-12 produced by M002 activates A. nancymae lymphocytes in vitro. We conclude that the safety and preclinical efficacy of M002 warrants the advancement of a Δγ(1)34.5 virus expressing IL-12 to Phase I clinical trials for patients with recurrent malignant glioma." ;

Patient recruitment into the 2nd phase of the DERMA-ER-DC 06 trial has started (sequential adaptive design). Immunomonitoring of first patients showed efficient induction of broad immune responses.

However, we unexpectedly could not demonstrate any depletion of Tregs by ONTAK (ccoperation with P14). ONTAK treatment induced a transient depletion of all known DC subpopulations in the peripheral blood, a novel and very unexpected finding.

One possible reason for the discrepancies between our findings and published data  could be the amount of ONTAK used in patients. We therefore filed an amendment allowing the inclusion of additional 4 patients, who will receive higher doses (12microg/kg 3x and 18microg/kg 1x) before vaccination. Taking into account direct effects of ONTAK on DC, patients will be vaccinated some days after last ONTAK treatment (as soon as blood DC have recovered to 50% of pre ONTAK amount).""" ;

This work was performed by Christian A. Luber (PhD student). First, we have set up a system for SILAC labelling of bone marrow derived murine dendritic cells (BM-DC). The principal method for generating BM-DC with GM-CSF was adapted from Lutz et al. (J Immunol Methods 1999, 223: 77-92). After some modifications of the protocol the FACS analysis of DC, which were generated in conditions described by Lutz et al. or in modified SILAC conditions did not show differences in the expression levels of the common DC markers CD11c, CD80, CD86. Analysis by mass spectrometry showed successful labelling." ;

      dc:description "Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly (I:C)) has been formerly known to be an interferon inducer but the mechanism of its action was not revealed until the discovery of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs are members of transmembrane proteins that recognize conserved molecular motifs of viral and bacterial origin and initiate innate immune response. Recent studies have shown that they are also expressed on tumor cells, but their role in these cells is still not clear. TLR3 recognizes double-stranded RNA (poly (I:C)) and is primarily involved in the defense against viruses. TLR3 ligand binding initiates the activation of transcription factors NF-κB, IRF family members, and AP-1, which can induce wide cascading effect on the cell and consequently activate many cellular processes. Since little is known about TLR3 target genes, we have used the proteomic approach to widen the current knowledge. In this study, we have discovered 15 differentially expressed proteins, mostly connected with protein metabolic processes. Furthermore, we have confirmed by Western blot that calreticulin and profilin-1, proteins which have been shown previously to be involved in processes connected with tumor progression, are differentially expressed after poly(I:C) treatment. By using TLR3 small interfering RNA, we showed that calreticulin expression might be TLR3 dependent, unlike profilin-1." ;

This study investigated whether the impaired cutaneous repair observed in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats was associated with altered macrophage activation. Our results show that macrophage activation phenotypes could be observed in wound healing through double immunostaining. The caM macrophages appeared in the initial stage of wound healing, followed by aaM macrophages, which predominated in normal wounds. However, through examining markers associated with activation by immunoblotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), diabetic wounds demonstrated insufficient caM in the early stage but excessive aaM in the later proliferative phase. Moreover, the macrophage activation markers were correlated with the instructive T helper cell type 1 (Th1)/Th2 cytokines in both groups. It was indicated that changed macrophage activation might contribute to impaired healing in diabetes wounds, and that strategies for reverting this abnormal activation could be useful for enhancing the wound healing process." ;

These deliver antigens to DC at very high efficiency and activate the transduced cells similarly to LPS. Based on this technology, Biovex began a clinical program where an HSV vector expressing full length tyrosinase, gp100 and MART-1 was used to transduce DC from melanoma patients which were then to be used for vaccination. Due to a change in emphasis, Biovex is no longer progressing this program but has, as a result, considerable internal expertise, reagents and methodology which could be of use to the project if partners would like to use HSV-based technology for the delivery of antigens to DC.

      dc:description "Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have displayed considerable promise for the treatment of cancer. However, their delivery to the desired cell population remains a challenging task. Here we have covalently conjugated a siRNA against survivin to gastrin-releasing peptides (GRP) to direct siRNA molecules to cancer cells that express the GRP receptor. The cellular uptake of the peptide-siRNA conjugates was tested in breast MDA-MB 231 cancer cells, which express the GRP receptor. Fluorescein-tagged GRP-siRNA conjugates were taken up by cancer cells, but not normal mammary epithelial cells or human blood monocytes. By 180 min of incubation, most of the cells have taken up the conjugates. Excess of free peptide inhibited uptake, implying dependence of uptake on GRP receptor. Moreover, bi-targeting of siRNA molecules by GR and luteinizing hormone-releasing peptides accelerated the uptake kinetics by MDA-MB 231 cells when compared to mono-targeted siRNAs. Peptide-siRNA conjugates, but not free siRNAs, inhibited the expression of survivin, an endogenous gene involved in cancer cell survival. None of the peptide-siRNA conjugates induced the expression of inflammatory cytokines or interferon α in human blood leukocytes. Overall, the data demonstrate the feasibility of GRP receptor-mediated targeted delivery of siRNAs to cancer cells, an important step for RNA interference therapy in humans." ;

The Phase 2 trial has the same general design, dosing regimen, endpoints, and immunomonitoring plan as the completed RCC trial. 
However, the Phase 2 study tests the improved RCC product (i.e., PME-CD40L DC) and is restricted to RCC patients with clear cell histology. 

As predicted from the in vitro data, the improved PME-CD40L DC product does indeed lead to restoration of both IL-2 and IFN-? responses. Also consistent with our in vitro observation is the gradual decline of the immune effector T cells in the peripheral circulation (i.e., weaker signal after the fifth dose). This is indicative of T cell effector memory maturation (i.e., CD8+/CD28+/CD45RA- T cells) which are equipped to leave the peripheral circulation and infiltrate the tissues in surveillance of target antigens. It is also noteworthy that presence of CD28+ T cells in tumor lymphocytic infiltrates correlates with favorable clinical outcome.

In contrast to the disease stabilization observed in our first RCC study, using the PME-CD40L DC product we have observed tumor regressions in a number of patients in the current study. At present, 6 of 12 patients that have been restaged using RECIST criteria have less tumor burden that when they enrolled in the study (15 weeks earlier). """ ;

YM155 selectively suppresses the expression of survivin and induces apoptosis in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism underlying these effects of YM155 is unknown. Here, we show that a transcription factor, interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3 (ILF3)/NF110, is a direct binding target of YM155. The enhanced survivin promoter activity by overexpression of ILF3/NF110 was attenuated by YM155 in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that ILF3/NF110 is the physiological target through which YM155 mediates survivin suppression. The results also show that the unique C-terminal region of ILF3/NF110 is important for promoting survivin expression and for high affinity binding to YM155." ;

      dc:description "BACKGROUND: Quite a number of strategies have been used to improve the efficacy of the DNA vaccine for the treatment of tumors. These strategies, ranging from activating CD4(+) T cell, manipulating antigen presentation, and/or processing to anti-angiogenesis, focus on one certain aspect in the functioning of the vaccine. Therefore, combination is necessary for rational DNA vaccines design by synergizing different regimens and overcoming the limitations of each strategy. METHODS: A DNA fragment (HSV) encoding the C terminal 37aa of human chorionic gonadotropin β chain (hCGβ), 5 different HLA-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes from human survivin and the 3rd and 4th extracellular domains of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) was inserted into the sequence between the luminal and transmembrane domain of human lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1) cDNA for the construction of a novel DNA vaccine. RESULTS: This novel vaccine, named p-L/HSV, has a potent antitumor effect on the LL/2 lung carcinoma model in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. The immunologic mechanism involved in the antitumor effect referred to the activation of both cellular and humoral immune response. In addition, the tumor vasculature was abrogated as observed by immunohistochemistry in p-L/HSV immunized mice. Furthermore, the mice received an additional boost with p-L/HSV 6 months later showed a strong immune recall response. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that the strategies of combining antitumor with antiangiogenesis and targeting the tumor antigen to the MHC II pathway cooperate well. Such a study may shed new light on designing vaccine for cancer in the future. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd." ;

      dc:description "A proper innate inflammatory response is essential for prevention of the systemic inflammation associated with sepsis. BTLA is an immune-regulatory receptor demonstrated to be expressed not only on adaptive immune populations and have potent inhibitory effects on CD4(+) T cells but is also expressed on innate cell populations (CD11c(+) and CD11b(+) cells) and has been shown to diminish pathogen clearance following bacterial and parasite infection. The role of BTLA in sepsis and the mechanisms by which BTLA alters pathogen clearance, however, have not been addressed clearly. Here, we show that following acute experimental sepsis induction in mice (CLP), the number of infiltrating BTLA- and HVEM (the ligand for BTLA)-expressing macrophages, inflammatory monocytes, mature and immature DCs, and neutrophils increased in the peritoneum compared with sham surgery, suggesting that a high level of HVEM:BTLA interactions occurs between these cells at the site of septic insult. Given this, we evaluated BTLA(-/-) mice, 24 h post-CLP, and observed a marked increase in the degree of activation on these cell populations, as well as a reduction in peritoneal bacterial burden and IL-10 induction, and most importantly, BTLA(-/-)mice exhibited a higher rate of survival and protection from organ injury when compared with WT mice. Such changes were not restricted to experimental mice, as circulating BTLA+ and HVEM+ monocytes and HVEM+ granulocytes were increased in septic ICU patients, supporting a role for BTLA and/or HVEM as potential, novel diagnostic markers of innate immune response/status and as therapeutic targets of sepsis." ;

To better understand the signaling pathways active in sarcoma, we examined global tyrosine phosphorylation in sarcoma cell lines and human tumor samples. Anti-phospho-tyrosine antibodies were used to purify tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides, which were then identified using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. The findings were validated using RNA interference, rescue, and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We identified 1,936 unique tyrosine phosphorylated peptides, corresponding to 844 unique phospho-tyrosine proteins. In sarcoma cells alone, peptides corresponding to 39 tyrosine kinases were found. Four of ten cell lines demonstrated dependence on tyrosine kinases for growth and/or survival, including PDGFR, MET, insulin receptor/IGF1R signaling, and SRC family kinase signaling. Rhabdomyosarcoma samples demonstrated over-expression of PDGFR in 13% of examined cases, and sarcomas demonstrated abundant tyrosine phosphorylation and expression of a number of tyrosine-phosphorylated tyrosine kinases, including DDR2, EPHB4, TYR2, AXL, SRC, LYN, and FAK. Together, our findings suggest that integrating global phosphoproteomics with functional analyses using kinase inhibitors can identify drivers of sarcoma growth and survival." ;

      dc:description "PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to evaluate the role of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for symptomatic choroidal nevus with subretinal fluid (SRF) extending to the fovea. METHODS: Retrospective review of the medical records of all patients who underwent PDT for a symptomatic choroidal nevus with SRF. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were included in the study. The mean initial visual acuity was 20/80 (range, counting fingers to 20/20). The mean initial tumor thickness was 1.23 mm (range, 0.66-1.93 mm). All tumors presented at least 2 risk factors for growing (including orange pigment, symptoms, peripapillary location, SRF, and thickness >2 mm). The mean number of PDT sessions was 1.41 (range, 1-3). The mean final visual acuity improved to 20/60 (range, counting fingers to 20/20). Subretinal fluid was reduced in all eyes (100%) and had completely disappeared in 9 eyes (53%) after PDT. Of 9 cases with complete resolution of the SRF, 2 patients (22%) presented recurrence. The mean final tumor thickness increased to 1.24 mm (range, 0.66-2.01 mm) at a mean follow-up of 22.47 months (range, 6-60 months). Tumor thickness increased in 3 eyes (18%) and remained unchanged in 13 eyes (76%), and 1 lesion (6%) shrank down to a flat chorioretinal scar. CONCLUSION: Photodynamic therapy is a good treatment option to reduce SRF in symptomatic choroidal nevus with serous macular detachment. Further growth into melanoma was observed in 18% of cases. Thus, PDT may not allow a good local tumor control. Longer follow-up is required to determine its value in these patients." ;

      dc:description "Although intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are continuously exposed to high densities of enteric bacteria, they are not highly responsive to microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). However, inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ) are potentially capable of priming IECs to enhance responsiveness to MAMPs. In this study, we observed that heat-killed Vibrio cholerae (HKVC) and its lipopolysaccharide (LPS) poorly induced IL-8 production in a human IEC line, HT-29. However, both HKVC and the LPS showed a substantial induction of IL-8 production in IFN-γ-primed HT-29 cells. LPS-induced IL-8 production was proportional to the IFN-γ-priming period and LPS could not induce IL-8 production in the presence of polymyxin B. Moreover, LPS-induced IL-8 production in the IFN-γ-primed HT-29 cells was mediated through signaling pathways requiring p38 kinase and ERK, but not the JNK/SAPK pathway. Since deleted in malignant brain tumor 1 (DMBT1) is known to interact with and antagonize the action of LPS, we hypothesized that IFN-γ enhanced the responsiveness to LPS in HT-29 through down-regulation of DMBT1. We found that IFN-γ indeed attenuated DMBT1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in HT-29 cells. Conversely, when the cells were transfected with small interfering RNA to specifically silence DMBT1, IL-8 expression was augmented even in the absence of IFN-γ and the augmentation was further enhanced by treatment with V. cholerae LPS. Since IFN-γ is known to increase IFN-β expression in the IECs, we examined if IFN-β functioned similar to IFN-γ. Although IFN-β alone was able to induce IL-8 expression, it failed to render HT-29 cells responsive to V. cholerae LPS. In conclusion, our study suggests that IFN-γ primes IECs to become responsive to V. cholerae and its LPS by suppressing the expression of DMBT1." ;

The protein has been sub-classified into three variant groups. Most anti-fHbp antibodies are variant group-specific and recognize epitopes on the C-terminal domain. We report a murine IgG1 mAb, JAR 41, which broadly cross-reacted with fHbp sequence variants from all variant groups. The mAb bound to the surface of live meningococci with fHbp from each of the three variant groups. In combination with second non-bactericidal anti-fHbp mAbs, JAR 41 elicited complement-mediated bactericidal activity in vitro, and augmented passive protection against meningococcal bacteremia in human fH transgenic rats. The epitope was located on a conserved region of the N-terminal portion of the fHbp molecule opposite that of fH contact residues. The data underscore the importance of broadly cross-reactive, surface-exposed epitopes on the N-terminal domain in the design of protective fHbp vaccines." ;

Group 3 received separate injections of E6 and E7 peptides, each at a dose of 50 micrograms per peptide. The primary endpoint was to determine safety and toxicity of the HPV16 long peptide vaccine. In addition, the vaccine-induced T-cell response was assessed by IFN gamma-ELISPOT. No toxicity beyond grade II was observed during and after 4 vaccinations. In a few patients transient flu-like symptoms were observed. ELISPOT analysis of the vaccine-induced immune response revealed that co-injection of the E6 and E7 peptides resulted in a strong and broad T-cell response dominated by immunity against E6. Injection of the E6 and E7 peptides at two different sites increased the E7-response but did not affect the magnitude of the E6-induced immune response." ;

      dc:description "Due to their unique antimicrobial properties silver nanocrystallites have garnered substantial attention and are used extensively for biomedical applications as an additive to wound dressings, surgical instruments and bone substitute materials. They are also released into unintended locations such as the environment or biosphere. Therefore it is imperative to understand the potential interactions, fate and transport of nanoparticles with environmental biotic systems. Numerous factors including the composition, size, shape, surface charge, and capping molecule of nanoparticles are known to influence cell cytotoxicity. Our results demonstrate that the physical/chemical properties of the silver nanoparticles including surface charge, differential binding and aggregation potential, which are influenced by the surface coatings, are a major determining factor in eliciting cytotoxicity and in dictating potential cellular interactions. In the present investigation, silver nanocrystallites with nearly uniform size and shape distribution but with different surface coatings, imparting overall high negativity to high positivity, were synthesized. These nanoparticles included poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride-Ag, biogenic-Ag, colloidal-Ag (uncoated), and oleate-Ag with zeta potentials +45 ± 5, -12 ± 2, -42 ± 5, and -45 ± 5 mV, respectively; the particles were purified and thoroughly characterized so as to avoid false cytotoxicity interpretations. A systematic investigation on the cytotoxic effects, cellular response, and membrane damage caused by these four different silver nanoparticles was carried out using multiple toxicity measurements on mouse macrophage (RAW-264.7) and lung epithelial (C-10) cell lines. Our results clearly indicate that the cytotoxicity was dependent on various factors such as surface charge and coating materials used in the synthesis, particle aggregation, and the cell-type for the different silver nanoparticles that were investigated. Poly(diallyldimethylammonium)-coated Ag nanoparticles were found to be the most toxic, followed by biogenic-Ag and oleate-Ag nanoparticles, whereas uncoated or colloidal silver nanoparticles were found to be the least toxic to both macrophage and lung epithelial cells. Also, based on our cytotoxicity interpretations, lung epithelial cells were found to be more resistant to the silver nanoparticles than the macrophage cells, regardless of the surface coating." ;

Circulating tumour cells (CTC) are present in the peripheral blood of a significant proportion of cancer patients.Methods:High molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMW-MAA) was used to isolate melanoma cells from peripheral blood as it is selectively expressed at high levels on melanomas. The HMW-MAA-positive cells were isolated using immunomagnetic beads. After removing CD45(+) cells, CTC were identified by staining with MART-1- and gp100-specific antibodies (HMW-MAA(+), CD45(-), MART-1/gp100(+)). Single, isolated CTC were then subjected to BRAF and KIT mutational analysis.Results:CTC (HMW-MAA(+), CD45(-), MART-1/gp100(+)) were isolated from the blood of 11 patients and BRAF and KIT were sequenced in nine and four patients, respectively. The BRAF sequences identified in the CTC were inconsistent with those identified in autologous melanoma tumours in three patients and the KIT sequences were inconsistent in three patients. In addition, polyclonal BRAF mutations were identified in one patient and concomitant mutations in BRAF and KIT were identified in another patient.Conclusion:Melanoma cells show clonal heterogeneity. Therefore, CTC genotyping may be crucial for successful molecular-targeted therapy." ;

The founders, Rotgans, professor of Surgery, De Bussy, publisher, and De Vries, professor of Pathology, wanted to create a cancer institute ‘where patients suffering from malignant growths could be treated adequately and where cancer and related diseases could be studied’. They bought a house on one of the canals in Amsterdam and named it the ‘Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Huis’, after the famous Dutch microscopist. The clinic had room for 17 patients, while the laboratory could accommodate 8 to 10 scientists.

Nowadays, The Netherlands Cancer Institute-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital (NKI-AVL) accommodates approximately 550 scientists and scientific support personnel, 53 medical specialists, 180 beds, an out-patients clinic that receives 24,000 new patients each year, 5 operating theaters and 9 irradiation units. It is the only dedicated cancer center in The Netherlands and maintains an important role as a national and international center of scientific and clinical expertise, development and training.

The three major areas of research are fundamental, clinical and translational cancer research. A thorough understanding of the biological processes of normal cells is the basis for understanding cancerous cells. The laboratory covers all major areas of cancer research, with special emphasis on cell-based screens, mouse tumor models, cell biology, structural biology and epidemiology. The institute coordinates and participates in many clinical trials; most of these are phase 1, 2 or 3 studies of potential new treatments such as combinations of chemotherapeutics, radiotherapy and/or surgery. Results obtained from fundamental research are translated into clinical applications as part of our translation research program.

From its first inception the NKI-AVL saw close collaboration between scientists and clinicians as essential to fighting cancer. Having a laboratory and hospital under one roof in a single independent organization with an open and collaborative atmosphere has led to many important discoveries and improved therapies""" ;

This study evaluated the prognostic variables and surgical management of foot melanoma. Materials and Methods. Foot melanoma cases managed at an academic center from 1985 to 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Results. 46 patients were identified with a broad range of demographic characteristics. Overall recurrence was 32.6%: 19% acral lentiginous, 57% nodular, 66% superficial spreading, 30% melanoma unspecified, 50% severely atypical; 53% ulcerated, 23% nonulcerated; 29% on the dorsum of the foot, 17% heel, 60% ankle, 22% toe, 50% plantar; 0% <1 mm thick, 47% 1-4 mm, 33% >4 mm. 13 had positive nodes, 4 (31%) of whom recurred. Prognostic factors and recurrence did not correlate, and survival was 96% with a median followup of 91 months. Conclusions. Aggressive management of foot melanoma may result in excellent long-term survival even following disease recurrence." ;

Our work (Lelouard et al., JCB) demonstrates that DCs down-regulate and change the quality of translation in order to increase their survival, however during this process MHC I antigen processing is affected. This has important consequences for the way antigens should be introduced in DCs and how long after stimulation they should be used during vaccination application.

We have also initiated studies on the impact of dsRNA on the regulation of translation and the functional response of DCs (IFN production). We have now demonstrated that DCs enters an “unfolded protein response-like state and controls the phosphorylation of a key translation initiation factor (eIF2-a).  The quality of the translation is not only affected, but the overall capacity of DCs to respond to stress is also modified in order to increase their survival and resistance to viral infection. This observation has important consequences on the use of different adjuvants during DC based vaccination trial. 

We are going to finalize the projects with several publications. We will follow-up our studies on the impact of dsRNA on the regulation of translation and focus on DCs in vivo and on the regulation of IFN production. """ ;

      dc:description "The testis is an immunoprivileged site where local cell-initiated innate immunity plays a crucial role in anti-microbial responses. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) mediate innate immune responses in testicular somatic cells. Although several TLRs are expressed in some stages of male germ cells, the potential role of TLRs in triggering antimicrobial responses in the germ cells has yet to be exclusively studied. The current study demonstrates that TLR3 is constitutively expressed in spermatogonia and spermatocytes, and can be activated by a synthetic double-strained RNA analogue, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. TLR3 activation in these male germ cells up-regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin IL1B, IL6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, through activation of nuclear factor kappa B; it also induces production of type 1 interferons (IFNA and IFNB) through the activation of IFN regulatory factor 3. In addition, TLR3 activation increases the production of two major antiviral proteins, namely, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase and MX1 protein, by germ cells. Data in this article describe an antiviral response of male germ cells through the activation of TLR3 in vitro." ;

In addition, we have shown that the same DC can interact with Tregs and convert them into cells that co-express ROR?t and Foxp3 and produce IL-17. 
We have shown that this pathway can serve as an alternative to TLR signalling for allowing DC to become effector cells capable of priming CD4+ T cells. We have used agonists of the dectin-1/Syk pathway as adjuvants in vivo to induce DC activation and CD4+ T cell and antibody responses. We have shown that this operates in a dectin-1-dependent manner. We have also found induction of T-independent antibody responses via the same pathway. In addition, we have shown that tubulovesicular structures generated by cells overexpressing VSV-G act as adjuvants for inducing CD8+ and CD4+ T cell, as well as antibody responses in vivo. This is likely due to their DNA content and ability to trigger TLR9.

We will continue to use DC activation in vitro and, in particular, DC cytokine production as an assay to dissect innate pathways involved in DC activation. In parallel, we will continue to compare effector T cell instruction by DC activated via distinct innate receptors.""" ;

      dc:description "The objective of this study was to investigate the vascular status, left-ventricular mass and biomarkers of endothelial activation in hypertensive (HT) adolescents, with particular attention to comparing nonobese with obese patients. Seventy-nine newly diagnosed HT adolescents aged 15.1±2.1 years (divided into 34 nonobese and 45 obese) were compared with 35 healthy volunteers. Intima-media thickness (IMT), flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and left-ventricular mass index (LVMi) were determined using ultrasound. Adhesion molecules and inflammatory interleukins (ILs), together with lipids and insulin resistance (HOMA), were also studied. HT obese adolescents had higher triglycerides, HOMA, and elevated levels of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and soluble E-selectin compared with controls and nonobese HT patients. FMD was lower in HT groups (8.5±4.5% in nonobese, P=0.004; 8.1±4.9%, P=0.01 in obese vs 12.5±4.9%; in control), and IMT was higher (0.52±0.06 mm, P<0.001 in nonobese; 0.54±0.05 mm, P<0.001 in obese vs 0.42±0.05 mm in control). Higher LVMi was found in both HT groups, with the highest value in the nonobese group being 37.8±5.3 g m(-2.7) vs 28.4±5.3 g m(-2.7) in controls (P=0.003). In conclusion, nonobese HT adolescents had the same early cardiovascular deteriorations assessed ultrasonographically as their obese HT peers, although metabolic alterations and endothelial activation measured as plasma biomarkers were more pronounced in obese individuals. The potential mechanisms of early atherosclerosis in nonobese HT adolescents need further evaluation in prospective studies because these factors may differ considerably from those found in young obese individuals with HT.Journal of Human Hypertension advance online publication, 29 March 2012; doi:10.1038/jhh.2012.11." ;

However, due to the small pore size, generally below 5 nm in diameter, potential drugs that are loaded into the pore have been limited to small molecules. Herein, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery strategy based on MSNs possessing pores with an average diameter of 23 nm is presented. The siRNA is regarded as a powerful gene therapeutic agent for treatment of a wide range of diseases by enabling post-transcriptional gene silencing, so-called RNA interference. Highly efficient, sequence-specific, and technically very simple target gene knockdown is demonstrated using MSNs with ultralarge pores of size 23 nm in vitro and in vivo without notable cytotoxicity." ;

      dc:description "A simultaneous engagement of different pathogen recognition receptors provides a tailor-made adaptive immunity for an efficient defense against distinct pathogens. For example, cross-talk of TLR and C-type lectin signaling effectively shapes distinct gene expression patterns by integrating the signals at the level of NF-κB. In this study, we extend this principle to a strong synergism between the dectin-1 agonist curdlan and an inflammatory growth factor, GM-CSF. Both together act in synergy in inducing a strong inflammatory signature that converts immature dendritic cells (DCs) to potent effector DCs. A variety of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-2, and IL-12p70), costimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86, CD40, and CD70), chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CCL12, CCL17), as well as receptors and molecules involved in fugal recognition and immunity such as Mincle, dectin-1, dectin-2, and pentraxin 3 are strongly upregulated in DC treated simultaneously with curdlan and GM-CSF. The synergistic effect of both stimuli resulted in strong IκBα phosphorylation, its rapid degradation, and enhanced nuclear translocation of all NF-κB subunits. We further identified MAPK ERK as one possible integration site of both signals, because its phosphorylation was clearly augmented when curdlan was coapplied with GM-CSF. Our data demonstrate that the immunomodulatory activity of curdlan requires an additional signal provided by GM-CSF to successfully initiate a robust β-glucan-specific cytokine and chemokine response. The integration of both signals clearly prime and tailor a more effective innate and adaptive response against invading microbes and fungi." ;

METHODS:: This study included 32 locally advanced breast cancer patients. Tumoral expressions of survivin, TOP2A, and GSTP1 in serial biopsy specimens obtained before treatment, after sequential 4 cycles of doxorubicin+cyclophosphomide, and 4 cycles of docetaxel were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Survivin expressions were additionally analyzed in serial blood samples. RESULTS:: The pathologic complete response (pCR) rate and the overall response rate (clinical complete and partial) were 28% (n=9) and 91% (n=29), respectively. There were no statistically significant correlations between serial TOP2A expression levels and response. There was a nonsignificant trend toward an improved response rate with decreased survivin expression. A significant decrease in the GSTP1 expression level throughout treatment (P=0.014), which was also shown to be significantly correlated with a pCR (P=0.0001), was seen. Downregulation of GSTP1 after 4 cycles of anthracycline-based combination was independently associated with improved progression-free survival (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS:: Downregulation of GSTP1 is a significant predictor of pCR and improved progression-free survival during anthracycline-based and taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast cancer." ;

      dc:description "CD69 is highly expressed by lymphocytes at mucosal surfaces. We aimed to investigate the role of CD69 in mucosal immune responses. The expression of CD69 by CD4 T cells isolated from the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, small intestinal lamina propria, and colonic lamina propria was determined in specific pathogen-free B6 and TCR transgenic animals, as well as in germ-free B6 mice. Transfer colitis was induced by transplanting RAG(-/-) mice with B6 or CD69(-/-)CD45RB(high) CD4 T cells. CD69 expression by CD4 T cells is induced by the intestinal microflora, oral delivery of specific Ag, and type I IFN (IFN-I) signals. CD4 T cells from CD69(-/-) animals produce higher amounts of the proinflammatory cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-21, whereas the production of TGF-β1 is decreased. CD69-deficient CD4 T cells showed reduced potential to differentiate into Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in vivo and in vitro. The transfer of CD69(-/-)CD45RB(high) CD4 T cells into RAG(-/-) hosts induced an accelerated colitis. Oral tolerance was impaired in CD69(-/-) and IFN-I receptor 1-deficient mice when compared with B6 and OT-II × RAG(-/-) animals. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid treatment of RAG(-/-) mice transplanted with B6 but not CD69(-/-) or IFN-I receptor 1-deficient CD45RB(high) CD4 T cells attenuated transfer colitis. CD69 deficiency led to the increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, reduced Foxp3(+) regulatory T cell induction, impaired oral tolerance, and more severe colitis. Hence, the activation Ag CD69 plays an important role in regulating mucosal immune responses." ;

Based on our previous findings demonstrating a bidirectional activating interaction between immature MDDCs and gamma-delta T lymphocytes (Conti et al., JI. 2005), as well as on the demonstration that HIV-1 exposed MDDCs exhibit an impaired functional maturation (Fantuzzi et al., J Virol  2004), we are currently investigating whether exposure of DCs or gamma-delta T lymphocytes to HIV-1 can directly modulate their functions or interfere with their cross-talk.  Preliminary results indicated that, although virus exposure of gamma-delta T cells does not significantly affect their properties, HIV-exposed DCs exhibit a reduced capacity to deliver activation and proliferative signals to gamma-delta T lymphocytes. Moreover, a dysregulated pattern of cytokines and chemokines produced by both cell populations is observed in the presence of the virus.

Our preliminary results indicating that HIV-exposed MDDCs exhibit a reduced capacity to deliver activation and proliferative signals to gamma-delta T lymphocytes have been reproduced in a statistically significant number of donors during this year. In particular, we have observed that gamma-delta T cells co-coltured with virus-exposed DCs exhibit a reduced capacity to proliferate in response to phosphoantigens and to produce IFN-?. Reciprocally, HIV-1-exposed DCs co-coltured with activated gamma-delta T lymphocytes undergo phenotypic maturation but are impaired in IL-12 production. In contrast, direct exposure of lymphocytes to the virus does not significantly affect their properties. A preliminary analysis of the miR profile expressed in HIV-exposed DCs has also been carried out indicating that interaction of these cells with the virus rapidly induces the modulation of a number of miRs.

A further characterization of the effects of HIV-1 on the functional properties of both cell populations will be performed, and in particular it will be analyzed: 
(a) the capacity of virus-exposed DCs to recruit resting gamma-delta T cells; 
(b) the role of activated lymphocytes in controlling HIV-1 replication in DCs; 
(c) whether active virus replication in these cells is needed to achieve the above described effects; 
(d) the role of HIV-modulated miR in DC functions. """ ;

      dc:description "Hypertension in rats with chronic placental ischemia (Reduced Uterine Perfusion Pressure) is associated with elevated inflammatory cytokines, agonistic autoantibodies to the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1-AA) and CD4(+)T cells; all of which are elevated in preclamptic women. Additionally, we have shown that adoptive transfer of RUPP CD4(+)T cells increases blood pressure, inflammatory cytokines and sFlt-1. The objective of this study was to determine the long-term effects of RUPP CD4(+)T cells on AT1-AA, renal and systemic hemodynamics in pregnant rats. To answer this question CD4(+)T splenocytes were magnetically isolated on day 19 of gestation from control RUPP and normal pregnant (NP) rats, and injected into a new group of NP rats at day 13 of gestation. On day 19 of gestation mean arterial pressure (MAP) and renal function (GFR) were analyzed and serum collected for AT1-AA analysis. To determine a role for AT1-AA to mediate RUPP CD4(+)Tcell induced blood pressure increases, MAP was analyzed in a second group of rats treated with AT1 receptor blockade, Losartan 10 mg/kg/day, and in a third group of rats treated with Rituximab, a B cell depleting agent (250 mg/kg) we have shown previously to decrease AT1-AA production in RUPP rats. MAP increased from 101+/-2 mmHg NP to 126+/-2 mmHg in RUPP rats (P<0.001) and to 123+/-1 mmHg in NP+RUPPCD4(+)T cells (P<0.001). Furthermore, GFR decreased from 2.2ml/min (n=7) in NP rats to 1.0ml/min (n=5) NP + RUPP CD4(+) Tcell. Circulating AT1-AA increased from 0.22+/-0.1 units in NP rats to 13+/-0.7 (P<0.001) units in NP+RUPPCD4(+)Tcell treated rats. Hypertension in NP+RUPPCD4(+)Tcell group was attenuated by Losartan, (102+/-4 mmHg) and with B cell depletion (101+/-5 mmHg). Therefore, we conclude that one mechanism of hypertension in response to CD4(+)T lymphocytes activated during placental ischemia is via AT1 receptor activation, potentially via AT1-AA during pregnancy." ;

Antigen-naïve T cells rely on survival signals through contact with self-peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules plus interleukin (IL)-7. Conversely, antigen-experienced (memory) T cells are typically MHC-independent and they survive and undergo periodic homeostatic proliferation through contact with both IL-7 and IL-15. Also, non-conventional γδ T cells rely on a mix of IL-7 and IL-15 for their homeostasis, whereas natural killer cells are mainly dependent on contact with IL-15. Homeostasis of CD4(+) T regulatory cells is different in being chiefly regulated by contact with IL-2. Notably, increased levels of these cytokines cause expansion of responsive lymphocytes, such as found in lymphopenic hosts or following cytokine injection, whereas reduced cytokine levels cause a decline in cell numbers." ;

      rdfs:comment """Data were produced in our lab on a broad spectrum of priming events and their  impact on the effector and memory phases of the CTL response.

Activation of a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in an antigen-exposed lymph node involves a great diversity of encounters between naive CTLs and APCs that differ in both duration and quality. This broad spectrum of priming events instigates a complex blend of CTL developmental pathways. 

Using an experimental system that allows tight control over CTL priming, we have singled out defined priming events and analyzed the impact of the resulting instructional program on the effector and memory phases of the CTL response. As expected, prolonged antigenic stimulation induces potent CTL expansion, effector function and CTL memory. In contrast, CTL that have received suboptimal stimulation fail to undergo extensive expansion. Nevertheless these arrested CTL persist long term and acquire memory function in the absence of further cell division. Thus our data demonstrate that CTL memory can develop as a result of a suboptimal stimulation that causes arrested clonal expansion. 

The effect of environmental factors on development of high affinity CTL was investigated using a system whereby OT-1 cells were primed in vitro by engineered APC. After a 20 h priming phase, CTL were transferred to recipient mice that were either naïve, or had been injected with activated dendritic cells one day earlier, thus creating a reactive lymph node. Note that the reactive lymph node that is thus created does not harbour specific antigen. Using this system we are able to separate cognate antigenic and co-stimulatory signals that were uniformly delivered by the APC in vitro, from environmental factors such as growth factors, which are present in the reactive lymph node. Although primary responses were not affected by a reactive lymph node environment, responses to secondary antigenic challenge of CTL that had developed in a reactive lymph node were significantly enhanced. Experiments using CD40 and IL-12 knock out mice and IL-7R blocking antibody suggest that these factors do not play a role. IL-15 is a likely candidate molecule mediating the observed effect, but in the (genetic) absence of IL-15 memory cells do not survive and no secondary responses could be detected. """ ;

      dc:description "Visualization of DNA-protein interactions by atomic force microscopy (AFM) has deepened our understanding of molecular processes such as DNA transcription. Interpretation of systems where more than one protein acts on a single template, however, is complicated by protein molecules migrating along the DNA. Single-molecule AFM imaging experiments can reveal more information if the polarity of the template can be determined. A nucleic acid-based approach to end-labelling is desirable because it does not compromise the sample preparation procedures for biomolecular AFM. Here, we report a method involving oligonucleotide loop-primed synthesis for the end labelling of double-stranded DNA to discriminate the polarity of linear templates at the single-molecule level. Single-stranded oligonucleotide primers were designed to allow loop formation while retaining 3'-single-strand extensions to facilitate primer annealing to the template. Following a DNA polymerase extension, the labelled templates were shown to have the ability to form open promoter complexes on a model nested gene template using two Escherichia coli RNA polymerases in a convergent transcription arrangement. Analysis of the AFM images indicates that the added loops have no effect on the ability of the promoters to recruit RNA polymerase. This labelling strategy is proposed as a generic methodology for end-labelling linear DNA for studying DNA-protein interactions by AFM." ;

      dc:description "Biogenesis of trans-acting siRNAs (tasiRNAs) is initiated by miRNA-directed cleavage of TAS gene transcripts and requires RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6) and Dicer-like 4 (DCL4). Here, we show that following miR173 cleavage the entire polyadenylated parts of Arabidopsis TAS1a/b/c and TAS2 transcripts are converted by RDR6 to double-stranded (ds)RNAs. Additionally, shorter dsRNAs are produced following a second cleavage directed by a TAS1c-derived siRNA. This tasiRNA and miR173 guide Argonaute 1 complexes to excise the segments from TAS2 and three TAS1 transcripts including TAS1c itself to be converted to dsRNAs, which restricts siRNA production to a region between the two cleavage sites. TAS1c is also feedback regulated by a cis-acting siRNA. We conclude that TAS1c generates a master siRNA that controls a complex network of TAS1/TAS2 siRNA biogenesis and gene regulation. TAS1/TAS2 short dsRNAs produced in this network are processed by DCL4 from both ends in distinct registers, which increases repertoires of tasiRNAs." ;

Using specific inhibitors we have previously found that src-family tyrosine kinases are required for cytokines and chemokines production during maturation of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) upon stimulation with several toll like receptor (TLR) agonists. We have now evaluated the role of Src kinases in DCs during synergic engagement of TLR8 with either TLR4 or TLR3. We tested if src-family tyrosine kinases inhibitors had any effect on the high levels of cytokine production induced in monocyte-derived DCs upon the synergistic stimulation of TLRs. Using the DNA microarray technology we have also analyzed which are the genes that require activation of Src kinases during TLR3 stimulation of monocyte-derived DCs. This pathway analysis will be of help in the elucidation of the molecular mechanism by which Src kinases regulate inflammatory cytokine production in DCs. """ ;

      rdfs:comment "Our group obtained data on molecular signaling triggered by LPS in dendritic cells and the role of CD14 in the regulation of the DC life cycle through NFAT activation. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the best-characterized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Individual TLRs recruit diverse combinations of adapter proteins, and thereby trigger signal transduction pathways leading to the activation of various transcription factors, including nuclear factor (NF)-kB, activation protein (AP)-1, and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is one of the molecules produced by mouse dendritic cells (DCs) after stimulation by TLR agonists. By analogy with the events following T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement leading to IL-2 production, it is therefore plausible that the stimulation of TLRs on DCs may lead to activation of the Ca2+/calcineurin and NFAT pathway. Our contribution to the project has been the finding that the DC stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces Src-family kinase and phospholipase C (PLC)?2 activation, influx of extracellular Ca2+ and calcineurin-dependent nuclear NFAT translocation. The initiation of this pathway is independent of TLR4 engagement, and dependent exclusively on CD14. We also show that LPS-induced NFAT activation via CD14 is necessary to cause death of terminally differentiated DCs (supplementary Fig. 1), an event that is essential for maintaining self-tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. Consequently, blocking this pathway in vivo causes prolonged DC survival and an increase in T cell priming capability. Our findings reveal novel aspects of the molecular signaling triggered by LPS in DCs and identify a new role for CD14: the regulation of the DC life cycle through NFAT activation. " ;

Priming of adult MMTV-7-negative mice with vSAG-7-expressing cells initially results in the activation of the peripheral V beta 6/CD4+ T cell compartment and is followed by T cell tolerance to the superantigen. During the course of tolerance induction the number of recipient B lymphocytes increases in the lymph nodes, but not the spleen, of vSAG-7-primed recipients. These B cells also express increased levels of class II MHC and present passively acquired superantigen. In this study we asked if these effects on the host B cell compartment are followed by the production of immunoglobulin. Priming of MMTV-7-negative BALB/c or CB.17 mice with vSAG-7-expressing cells from DBA/2 mice induced increases of both IgM and IgG2a in the serum. Use of Igh congenic CB.17 (IgMb) mice as recipients of the vSAG-7-presenting cells from DBA/2 (IgMa) donors indicated that the IgM and IgG produced were entirely of host origin. Priming with vSAG-7 also amplified (four- to fivefold) the antibody-producing cell response induced to a suboptimal dose of sheep RBC. Priming with purified B cells from vSAG-7 donors resulted in recipient V beta 6/CD4+ T cell activation and increased numbers of recipient B cells in the lymph nodes, but did not induce immunoglobulin production. In contrast, priming with purified CD8+ T cells resulted in increased quantities of serum IgM but not vSAG-7-reactive T cell activation or increased numbers of recipient B cells in the lymph nodes. These results indicate that the T cell activation and increased B cell number with upregulated class II MHC expression initially observed following vSAG-7 priming of adult MMTV-7-negative recipients are not linked to the induction of the recipient-derived immunoglobulin production." ;

Methods: In order to investigate the role of immune cell infiltration in the progression of DTC, we studied 398 patients - 253 with papillary and 13 with follicular thyroid cancers, as well as 132 with nonmalignant tissues. MUC1, NIS, ATM, PTEN, and CD56 protein expressions were assessed by immunohistochemistry; immune cell infiltration was identified using CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68, and FoxP3 immunohistochemical markers. In addition, we investigated infiltration of Th17 lymphocytes and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Findings: Furthermore, expression of MUC1, NIS, ATM, PTEN, CD56 and B7H1 was accompanied by infiltration of a mixture of different immune cells, suggesting this profile may be related to antitumor immune response. Tumors with high B7H1 expression were frequently enriched with MDSCs (p=0.03256), suggesting that a complex immune evasion mechanism is engaged in DTC microenvironment. Interpretation: Our data suggest that the immune response may be influenced by the status of tumor antigenicity in DTC. Immune cell infiltration helped characterize specific tumor histotypes." ;

The effect of these kinase inhibitors on the capacity of DC to be activated by a TLR2 (PAM3CSK4), TLR3 (Poly I:C), TLR5 (Flagellin),  and TLR8 (Poly U) agonist was evaluated. Src kinases were found to be required for the initiation of some maturation characteristics but not of others, since their inhibition was able to dissociate cytokines and chemokines production from the induction of surface maturation markers. Additional studies of the signal transduction pathways revealed that active src kinases are required for c-Jun phosphorylation and stabilization, induced by triggering of TLRs." ;

Any population of macrophages was shown to change its properties depending on its microenvironment and concrete biological situation (the \"functional plasticity of macrophages\"). Many intermediate states of macrophages were described along with the most pronounced and well-known activation types (classical activation, alternative activation, and type II activation). These intermediate states are characterized by a variety of combinations of their biological properties, including elements of the three afore mentioned types of activation. Macrophage activity is regulated by a complex network of interrelated cascade mechanisms." ;

      rdfs:comment """Our data demonstrate that treatment of primed mice with intact anti-CTLA-4 antibodies induces the development of regulatory T cells expressing high levels of ICOS and producing IL-10. These regulatory T cells inhibit Th1 responses, in vitro and in vivo, and repress experimental intestinal inflammation, by a mechanism involving IL-10 and IDO. These ICOS+ regulatory T cells appear distinct from the naturally occurring regulatory T cells described above, suggesting that two populations can inhibit DC-induced Th1 responses in vivo.  Experiments are under way to identify the respective role and the synergy of IL-10 and IDO in the down-regulation of inflammatory responses in vivo. We have demonstrated the major role of IL-10 and indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase. We are presently trying to identify the cells expressing IDO (dendritic cells or epithelial cells?), using chimeras (WT/IDO KO) and purification of various cell populations from the lamina propria from control versus treated mice.
Our recent results have also shown that ICOS+ regulatory T cells are present in the colon of untreated mice, but absent in axenic animals, suggesting that their development is dependent on the intestinal flora. We will complete our experiments to further test the role of CD70 in Th1 priming in the presence or absence of regulatory T cells, and try to identify the mechanism by which these cells may downregulate the CD70 pathway. We will also pursue our study to identify the cells expressing indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase in the colon following anti-CTLA-4 treatment. 

Recent reports have suggested that regulatory T cells may affect the phenotype, survival and function of dendritic cells.
We have therefore tested whether the enhanced Th1 response correlated with increased expression of costimulatory molecules or increased production of IL-12 by dendritic cells. Our data (in vitro and in vivo) clearly show that the phenotype of these cells was not changed in the absence of regulatory T cells and that IL-12 was not required for enhanced Th1 priming. Our preliminary results point to a role of CD70, a membrane-associated molecule of the tumor necrosis  factor family. """ ;

In particular, the most relevant gene upregulated in presence of stimuli typically inducing Th1 responses (LPS, CpG, Poly I:C) but not in presence of the Th2 stimulus, Pam3Cys, was Stat-1. We then evaluated whether STAT-1 was phosphorylated in DC following activation with TLR-dependent Th1 and Th2 stimuli and we found that only in presence of TLR stimuli able to induce Th1 responses STAT-1 was activated. This observation strongly suggested that the molecules selectively produced by DC in presence of Th1 stimuli and not in presence of Th2 stimuli were type I IFNs and that these cytokines were presumably required for NK cell activation. In fact, our preliminary results confirmed this hypothesis with all of the Th1 stimuli tested including the Poly I-C stimulus that mimics viral infections." ;

The two main isoforms of these peptides have 40 (Aβ40) or 42 residues (Aβ42), the latter having a higher propensity to aggregate in vitro and being the main component of the plaques observed in vivo in AD patients. We have designed a series of tandem dimeric constructs of these Aβ peptides to probe the manner in which changes in the aggregation kinetics of Aβ affect its deposition and toxicity in a Drosophila melanogaster model system. The levels of insoluble aggregates were found to be substantially elevated in flies expressing the tandem constructs of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 as compared to the equivalent monomeric peptides, consistent with the higher effective concentration, and hence increased aggregation rate, of the peptides in the tandem repeat. A unique feature of the Aβ42 constructs, however, is the appearance of high levels of soluble oligomeric aggregates and a corresponding dramatic increase in their in vivo toxicity. The toxic nature of the Aβ42 peptide in vivo can therefore be attributed to the higher kinetic stability of the oligomeric intermediate states that it populates relative to those of Aβ40 rather than simply to its higher rate of aggregation." ;

Most non-replicating antigens are rather poor mucosal immunogens in comparison to replicating antigens. Therefore, a mucosal administered DNA vaccine, which actually mimics a live vaccine, could be promising. Protection was promoted by plasmids encoding the porcine granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (pcDNA3.1zeo::GM-CSF), the Escherichia coli thermo-labile enterotoxin (LT) subunit A (plasmid PJV2004::LTa) and subunit B (plasmid PJV2005::LTb). Mucosal C. trachomatis DNA vaccination induced significant protection against genital C. trachomatis challenge although the infection could not be eradicated. Intradermal immunization was significantly less efficient in protecting experimentally infected pigs. Protection was correlated with efficient T cell priming and significantly higher serum IgA titers following primo vaccination." ;

      rdfs:comment """Our lab has obtained data on the dependence of IL-10 as well as IL-12 production on signalling adaptor molecules.

Dendritic cells (DC) arise in the bone marrow and circulate through blood or tissue; upon pathogen challenge DC subsequently migrate to lymphoid organs to initiate immune responses (Banchereau et al., 1998). DC act as sentinels for pathogens forming the interface between the innate and adaptive immune response. In addition they are flexible in driving both Th1 and Th2 responses (Boonstra, Rajsbaum et al., 2003). Mouse DC can be derived from bone marrow (BM), which, after culture results in myeloid DC and plasmacytoid precursor DC (pDC), or can be directly isolated from the spleen, lymph nodes or tissue as classical DC (CD11cbright, CD8+ or CD8-) or plasmacytoid pDC. 

We have shown that macrophages, myeloid DC and plasmacytoid DC have the intrinsic capacity to produce different amounts of IL-12 upon stimulation through TLR9 and TLR4.  Some of this, but not all is accounted for by endogenous IL-10 production which inhibits the subsequent production of IL-12. In this respect we have identified specific regulatory elements in the IL-10 locus which are present in DC and macrophages but not T cells (Saraiva et al., 2005). 

We have now shown that both IL-10 as well as IL-12 production is dependent on the signalling adaptor molecules either MyD88 or TRIF, respectively in response to CpG, LPS or PolyIC. This work has been published in the J.Immunology (Boonstra, Rajsbaum et al, 2006).""" ;

      dc:description "To examine factors that regulate ceramide production during keratinization of the human stratum corneum (SC), we developed a reconstructed human epidermal keratinization model in which a fresh layer of SC is newly formed within 1 week. Addition of the UDP-glucose: ceramide glucosyltransferase inhibitor 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol significantly diminished SC ceramide levels (expressed as µg/mg protein) with decreased glucosylceramide levels. Desipramine hydrochloride, an inhibitor of sphingomyelinase, also significantly reduced SC ceramide levels. Similarly, conduritol B epoxide, an inhibitor of β-glucocerebrosidase, significantly down-regulated SC ceramide levels and significantly increased glucosylceramide levels. These results indicate the reliability of this model to elucidate ceramide synthesis regulating factors. Using this model, we assessed the effects of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1α (IL-1α), several bioactive sphingolipids and all-trans retinoic acid (RA) on ceramide levels in the SC. Whereas treatment with IL-1α (at 10 nM) significantly down-regulated ceramide levels, treatment with sphingosylphosphorylcholine (at 50 µM) or sphingosine-1-phosphate (at 10 or 20 µM) distinctly up-regulated ceramide levels. Interestingly, RA (at low as 10 nM) significantly up-regulated ceramide levels without affecting the formation of the SC or levels of keratinization-related proteins in the epidermis. The increased levels of ceramide were accompanied by a significantly increased secretion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor as well as by a significantly down-regulated expression of acid-ceramidase at both the gene and protein levels. Taken together, our results underscore the superiority of this reconstructed human epidermal keratinization model to analyze factors that regulate ceramide synthesis, especially in human SC." ;

      dc:description "RNA interference (RNAi) is a eukaryotic gene-silencing mechanism that functions as antiviral immunity in diverse organisms. To combat RNAi-mediated immunity, viruses encode viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) that target RNA and protein components in the RNAi machinery. Although the endonuclease Dicer plays key roles in RNAi immunity, little is known about how VSRs target Dicer. Here, we show that the B2 protein from Wuhan nodavirus (WhNV), the counterpart of Flock House virus (FHV), suppresses Drosophila RNAi by directly interacting with Dicer-2 (Dcr-2) and sequestering double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA). Further investigations reveal that WhNV B2 binds to the RNase III and PAZ domains of Dcr-2 via its C-terminal region, thereby blocking the activities of Dcr-2 in processing dsRNA and incorporating siRNA into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Moreover, we uncover an interrelationship among diverse activities of WhNV B2, showing that RNA binding enhances the B2-Dcr-2 interaction by promoting B2 homodimerization. Taken together, our findings establish a model on suppression of Drosophila RNAi by WhNV B2 targeting both Dcr-2 and RNA, and provide evidence that an interrelationship exists among diverse activities of VSRs to antagonize RNAi." ;

      dc:description "Accumulating preclinical evidence suggests that anticancer immune responses contribute to the success of chemotherapy. The predictive significance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic and predictive value of TIL subtypes in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. In total, 159 patients with stage III and IV NSCLC were retrospectively enrolled. The prevalence of CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+) and Foxp3(+) TILs was assessed by immunohistochemistry in tumor tissue obtained before chemotherapy. The density of TILs subgroups was treated as dichotomous variables using the median values as cutoff. Survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences in overall survival between groups were determined using the Log-rank test. Prognostic effects of TIL subsets density were evaluated by Cox regression analysis. The presence of CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), and FOXP3(+) TILs was not correlated with any clinicopathological features. Neither the prevalence of TILs nor combined analysis displayed obvious prognostic performances for overall survival in Cox regression model. Instead, higher FOXP3(+)/CD8(+) ratio in tumor sites was an independent factor for poor response to platinum-based chemotherapy in overall cohort. These findings suggest that immunological CD8(+) and FOXP3(+)Tregs cell infiltrate within tumor environment is predictive of response to platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients. The understanding of the clinical relevance of the microenvironmental immunological milieu might provide an important clue for the design of novel strategies in cancer immunotherapy." ;

The DC-THERA Directory is intended to collect and semantically organize this data and to serve as a tool for collaboration among researchers and as a reference point for the information contained. As such it is a directory that provides summarized information and relations between resources and people involved. 

In particular, we have defined a data model that mixes aspect of Object Oriented design and RDF-like features (RDF is the language at the basis of the Semantic Web). We have used this data-model to develop the DC-THERA Directory, a web application based on the Symfony web framework and Doctrine, an object-relational mapping (ORM).

As for the content of the directory, it has initially been populated it with information drawn from DC-THERA annual reports.

The semantic organization of the directory is based on fragments of standard ontologies, in particular OBI (Ontology for Biomedical Investigation) and terminologies developed within DC-ATLAS.
The first release of the DC-THERA directory was based on this information and ontologies, and provided the skeleton of the application, as well as a set of basic functionalities (semantic links among entities, lexical variations and generalization in searches).
Following this release, we have assembled a panel of reviewers, we have authored a document describing current functionalities and aims of the project, and we have asked for feedback on the current release as a well as a ranking, by relevance, of future functionalities to be implemented.

We will continue the development of functionalities of the DC-THERA Directory, following suggestions from reviewers and the user-base, and fostering the integration with other DC-THERA resources.

Here, we tested the efficacy of VA7 in immunocompetent orthotopic GL261 and CT-2A glioma models of C57BL/6 mouse in vivo. The cell lines were susceptible to VA7 infection in vitro, but GL261 infection was highly restricted in confluent cell cultures, and mouse interferon-β (IFNβ) pretreatment prevented the replication of VA7 in both cell lines. When mice bearing orthotopic GL261 or CT-2A tumors were administered neurotropic VA7, either i.v. or intracranially (i.c.), the vector was unable to infect the tumor and no survival benefit was achieved. Pretreatments with immunosuppressive cyclophosphamide (CPA) and rapamycin markedly lowered serum-neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) but had no effect on tumor infection or survival. Intracranial GL261 tumors were refractory also in athymic C57BL/6 mice, which have serious defects in their adaptive immunity. Implanted VA7-infected GL261 cells formed tumors with only slightly delayed kinetics and without improving survival thus excluding the participation of physical barriers and indicating robust host IFN action. Mouse and human IFNβ do not seem be species cross-reactive, which might limit the translational relevance of xenograft models in oncolytic virotherapy." ;

We studied two major blood populations of DCs, myeloid DCs (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). Among mDCs, three populations could be further identified by specific markers: CD16, CD1c and BDCA-3. The properties of these DC populations and their production of cytokines in response to different Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists were evaluated. The TLR agonists used were: PAM3CSK4, Poly I:C, LPS, Flagellin, Imiquimod, Resiquimod, CpG 2216, CpG 2006. While BDCA-3+ cells seem not have any capability to respond to TLR agonists, CD16 and CD1c produce a number of cytokines in response to these stimuli, with the exception of CpGs. In addition, we have found that CD16+ DCs are the major producers of TNF-alpha and IL-6, while CD1c+ DCs produce primarily IL-8.""" ;

      dc:description "ABSTRACT: Clear cell sarcoma is a unique soft tissue tumor with distinct microscopic features that include a nested or fascicular pattern of spindle cells accompanied by larger wreath-like giant cells scattered throughout. It harbors a unique EWSR1-ATF1 gene fusion secondary to a t(12;22)(q13;q12) translocation. Recently, it was reported that clear cell sarcoma can occur in the skin and mimic a broad spectrum of entities, including spindle cell melanoma. Here, we describe 3 new cases of clear cell sarcoma of the skin, all of which were confirmed molecularly. The patients, a 12-year-old boy, a 29-year-old woman, and a 60-year-old man, had cutaneous lesions on the thigh, dorsum of foot, and sole, respectively. All 3 lesions were originally considered suspicious of spindle cell melanoma. Microscopically, the lesions featured nodular proliferation centered in the dermis that consisted of discrete fascicles of spindle cell enmeshed by thin fibrous strands. Wreath-like cells were present in all cases. Tumor cells were positive for S100 protein (3 of 3 cases), melan A (2 of 3 cases), HMB 45 (1 of 3 cases) although a junctional melanocytic proliferation was seen in 1 case. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was negative in 2 patients. Follow-up was uneventful in 2 patients, whereas the other patient developed a lymph node metastasis 5 months after primary tumor excision. This study confirms that malignant dermal tumors that mimic but do not exactly replicate spindle cell melanoma should raise suspicion for cutaneous clear cell sarcoma and prompt the investigation for the confirmatory gene fusion t(12;22)." ;

Here, we evaluate the efficacy of a vaccine strain of S. typhimurium. CSO22 (pGM-CSF/SS, plasmid granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor/somatostatin) expressing two copies of SS genes. A total of 115 piglets, aged 2 months old, were either orally or intranasally immunized against the vaccine strain CSO22 (pGM-CSF/SS) with three dosages (5 × 1010 colony forming units (CFU), 5 × 109 CFU and 5 × 108 CFU). For oral immunization, the specific anti-SS antibodies were detected in the immunized piglets. The levels of SS antibodies in the high-dose immunized group (5 × 1010 CFU) were significantly higher than that in the phosphate buffered saline immunized group (P < 0.01) and 40% of animals were positive in SS antibodies in the high-dose immunized group. Moreover, the weight gain of the high-dose group was increased by 20.86%, 10.26% and 15.30% during 4, 8 and 12 weeks, respectively, after immunization in comparison to the control. For intranasal immunization, the growth of the low-dose group was increased by 10.23% in the whole test period (12 weeks). In conclusion, our results suggest that the recombinant strain could elicit anti-SS antibodies and improve the growth performance of immunized piglets, and that the oral immunization program is better than the intranasal program." ;

Interestingly the suppressive effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 was associated with a potent impairment of DC migration in response to inflammatory and lymph node homing chemokines, thus unraveling a novel mechanism involved in 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated immunomodulation. Experiments to characterise the molecular mechanisms underlining this inhibitory effect, including the expression of ILT-receptors and a panel of adhesion molecules known for their role in leukocyte migration are ongoing. Further studies are focussed on the dissection of the signal transduction pathway of 1,25(OH)2D3 in DCs, and on its interference with chemokine receptor signalling. " ;

We show with this plugin how the use of ontological knowledge in biological analysis can be extended through the use of inference. In particular, we present two examples relative to ontologies representing biological pathways: we demonstrate how these can be abstracted and visualized as interaction networks, and how reasoning on causal dependencies within elements of pathways can be implemented.

A core component of RDFScape was re-engineered in 2008 for continuing ‘Affymetrix’ analyses. This component allows the definition of functions based on ontology patterns, and their computation on numeric values. It is intended in particular to be used to define pathway scoring functions, based on microarray data, that will include  causal and functional information found in pathway ontologies.

This project is relevant also for the Pathway based analysis and it now attributes an increased value to pathway-based information. For these reasons, we have chosen to provide this module as independent from RDFScape.

We will explore the possibilities offered by RDFScape and the related function evaluator on pathways curated within DC-THERA and the database provided by Duccio Cavalieri.""" ;

PBMC are stimulated in limiting dilution conditions with a pool of overlapping peptides (15 amino acids) covering the protein. After 2 rounds of in vitro stimulation, the microcultures are left without stimulation for 2 weeks, and all the individual microcultures are then screened for recognition of autologous EBV-B cells transduced with a retrovirus encoding the protein. Non transduced EBV-B cells are used as control stimulator cells. Activated T cells are detected by their expression of CD137.""" ;

      dc:description "Mice homozygous for lpr and gld develop profound lymphadenopathy characterized by the accumulation of two functionally anergic T cell subsets, a predominant B220+CD4-CD8- double negative (DN) population and a minor, closely related CD4 dull+ B220+ population. Lymph nodes from diseased lpr and gld mice also contain abnormally high numbers of conventional T cells, and we reported recently that a high proportion of lpr and gld CD4+B220- T cells have the hallmarks of primed or memory T cells. In the present study, we further investigated the extent, ontogeny, and possible causes of T cell activation in lpr and gld mice. The criteria used to identify primed or memory T cells included activation-dependent increases in the expression of CD44, LFA-1, and the early activation Ag, CD69, and decreases in the expression of Mel-14 and CD45RB, as well as quantitative differences in the in vitro production of IFN-gamma and the TNF-alpha by stimulated cells. A comparison of TCR V beta gene utilization by lpr T cell subsets also was undertaken. The results showed that T cell activation was widespread and complex. CD8+ T cells exhibited a similar pattern of activation to CD4+B220- T cells. The activation of these two subsets occurred in parallel, was in evidence by 4 to 6 wk of age, and was both chronic and progressive. The proportions of CD44hiLFA-1hi, CD4+B220-, and CD8+ T cells increased steadily between 4 and 20 wk of age, but changes in T cell growth, Mel-14, and CD45RB expression and cytokine secretion were not observed until mice were older than 11 wk. A very different pattern of activation was observed for B220+ T cells. At all ages, B220+ DN and CD4+B220+ T cells were CD44hiMel-14hi and 60 to 75% were CD69+. The expression of CD69 appeared to be stimulus dependent rather than constitutive, suggesting that these cells, too, may be chronically stimulated in vivo. In keeping with their anergic state, DN T cells responded poorly to cross-linking of CD69. The stimuli inducing chronic activation of CD4+B220- and CD8+ T cells are unlikely to include inappropriate reactions to autoantigens because there was no evidence for selective accumulation of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells bearing particular V beta genes or potentially self-reactive cells that normally are deleted in the thymus. By comparison, C3H-lpr DN cells displayed some potentially significant differences in V beta 6 and V beta 9 expression from CD4+B220- and CD8+ T cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)" ;

The positive influence of a reactive lymph node on the priming of CD8+ T-cells was already analyzed in 2007. We set up experiments to determine if this effect would benefit a response against a second infection. We infected mice with CD8+ T-cells primed with or without the influence of a reactive lymph node with a flu-virus encoding the specific antigen. After several days we determined the viral load in the lungs with RT-PCR. The results show that in mice with CD8+ T-cells primed with a reactive lymph node the viral load in the lungs was significantly smaller then in a control mice. 
We also determined that suboptimally primed CD8+ T-cells can develop into functional memory cells. Although suboptimally primed CD8+ T-cells do not display good effector function, as previously enclosed, we found that they were efficient at eradicating tumors in the memory phase. 
Micro-array data obtained from samples from suboptimally primed CD8+ T-cells compared with optimally primed CD8+ T-cells showed several interesting genes involved in regulation of proliferation and development. 
 
We are currently working on verifying the data obtained with micro-arrays through RT-PCR, and comparing data from in vitro primed CD8+ T-cells to in vivo primed CD8+ T-cells. We intend to analyse the candidate genes through overexpression and siRNA experiments.""" ;

      dc:description "Recognition of the essential role of dendritic cells (DCs) as professional antigen-presenting cells has prompted investigators to search for methods to use DCs as natural adjuvants in immunotherapy. A number of antigenic oligopeptides, recognized by CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific for cancer cells, have been applied in clinical trials using DCs. Such a monovalent vaccine with a single epitope for a particular type of HLA class 1 molecule would be effective. However, a polyvalent vaccine might be more potent. We designed a novel protein delivery system consisting of hydrophobized polysaccharides complexed with target proteins. The truncated HER2 protein encompassing 147 N-terminal amino acids, including the 9-mer HER2p63-71 peptide (HER2p63), TYLPTNASL, the human homologue of an antigenic murine tumor rejection peptide, was prepared. We report here that HLA-A2402(+) DCs could incorporate hydrophobized polysaccharide-truncated HER2 protein complexes and process the protein to present major histocompatibility complex class 1-binding HER2p63 peptide. The complexes enter DCs by phagocytosis, and then the truncated protein is processed through a pathway similar to that for endogenous proteins. DCs sensitized by these complexes primed and boosted HER2p63-specific CD8(+) T cells in the context of HLA-A2402. Vaccination with DCs incorporating these complexes completely suppressed lung metastases in a HER2-expressing murine tumor model. We also generated 3 CD4(+) clones reactive with different HER2- derived 25-mer peptides from lymph node cells in mice treated with CHP/HER2-147. Thus, hydrophobized polysaccharide-protein complexes are promising candidates for the construction of polyvalent vaccines." ;

Therefore, the physical parameters such as aeration rate, pH, and temperature affecting PLA-degrading enzyme production by Actinomadura keratinilytica strain T16-1 in a 3 l airlift fermenter were investigated. The response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize PLA-degrading enzyme production by implementing the central composite design. The optimal conditions for higher production of PLA-degrading enzyme were aeration rate of 0.43 vvm, pH of 6.85, and temperature at 46° C. Under these conditions, the model predicted a PLA-degrading activity of 254 U/ml. Verification of the optimization showed that PLA-degrading enzyme production of 257 U/ml was observed after 3 days cultivation under the optimal conditions in a 3 l airlift fermenter. The production under the optimized condition in the airlift fermenter was higher than un-optimized condition by 1.7 folds and 12 folds with un-optimized medium or condition in shake flasks. This is the first report on the optimization of environmental conditions for improvement of PLA-degrading enzyme production in a 3 l airlift fermenter by using a statistical analysis method. Moreover, the crude PLA-degrading enzyme could be adsorbed to the substrate and degraded PLA powder to produce lactic acid as degradation products. Therefore, this incident indicates that PLA-degrading enzyme produced by Actinomadura keratinilytica NBRC 104111 strain T16-1 has a potential to degrade PLA to lactic acid as a monomer and can be used for the recycle of PLA polymer." ;

As IL-10 has been shown to indirectly dampen Th1 responses through the inhibition of IL-12 production by antigen-presenting-cells, we monitored mRNA expression specific for the inducible chain IL-12 p35 in lymph nodes draining the site of injection or in mesenteric lymph nodes of mice instilled intra-colonically with TNBS. Our results clearly show that IL-12 production early after the onset of the response was unaffected by anti-CTLA-4 treatment. By contrast, our data confirm previous data showing that IL-10 is critical for IDO production by DC in vitro, suggesting that IL-10 may act upstream by modulating the expression of IDO. As IDO expression was detected in the colon but not in the spleen or mesenteric lymph nodes, we postulate that IDO may act as anti-inflammatory agent in the intestine and that IL-10 may inhibit Th1 activation in the lymphoid organs and enhance IDO expression in the gut." ;

METHODS:: Repeated plasma samples were prospectively collected in hip fracture patients, aged 65 years and older. The presence of delirium was assessed daily. The associations of a delirious state and tryptophan, kynurenine, and the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio measured in samples taken 'before', 'during delirium', and 'after delirium' were analyzed with linear mixed models. RESULTS:: A total of 469 samples from 140 patients were collected. Adjusted for the days on which they were drawn, there was no difference for all three measured factors in patients with and without delirium, except for an association between a higher kynurenine/tryptophan ratio and delirium in a subgroup analysis in preoperative samples. CONCLUSIONS: The results do not confirm the previously found lower tryptophan levels in delirium on which the tryptophan depletion theory is based. However, a preoperative higher kynurenine/tryptophan ratio could be indicative of delirium." ;

As IL-10 has been shown to indirectly dampen Th1 responses through the inhibition of IL-12 production by antigen-presenting-cells, we monitored mRNA expression specific for the inducible chain IL-12 p35 in lymph nodes draining the site of injection or in mesenteric lymph nodes of mice instilled intra-colonically with TNBS. Our results clearly show that IL-12 production early after the onset of the response was unaffected by anti-CTLA-4 treatment. By contrast, our data confirm previous data showing that IL-10 is critical for IDO production by DC in vitro, suggesting that IL-10 may act upstream by modulating the expression of IDO. As IDO expression was detected in the colon but not in the spleen or mesenteric lymph nodes, we postulate that IDO may act as anti-inflammatory agent in the intestine and that IL-10 may inhibit Th1 activation in the lymphoid organs and enhance IDO expression in the gut." ;

As cellular metabolism is preserved during perfusion, it represents a potential platform for effective gene transduction in donor lungs. We hypothesized that vector-associated inflammation would be reduced during ex vivo delivery due to isolation from the host immune system response. We compared ex vivo with in vivo intratracheal delivery of an E1-, E3-deleted adenoviral vector encoding either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or interleukin-10 (IL-10) to porcine lungs. Twelve hours after delivery, the lung was transplanted and the post-transplant function assessed. We identified significant transgene expression by 12 hours in both in vivo and ex vivo delivered groups. Lung function remained excellent in all ex vivo groups after viral vector delivery; however, as expected, lung function decreased in the in vivo delivered adenovirus vector encoding GFP (AdGFP) group with corresponding increases in IL-1β levels. Transplanted lung function was excellent in the ex vivo transduced lungs and inferior lung function was seen in the in vivo group after transplantation. In summary, ex vivo delivery of adenoviral gene therapy to the donor lung is superior to in vivo delivery in that it leads to less vector-associated inflammation and provides superior post-transplant lung function." ;

      rdfs:comment """During 2008, we extended all the data regarding TLR3 signaling to TLR8 signaling. Cytokines assays and immunoblotting studies suggest that Src kinases play a crucial role in the control of both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways. We also extended microarray analysis on human MoDC stimulated with R848 (TLR8 agonist), pretreated or not with PP2. In summary, the new generated data on TLR8 triggered gene expression are similar to previous data obtained with TLR3 stimulation, and confirmed that src kinases inhibition is associated to inhibition of key genes in the inflammatory cytokine response. Interestingly, however, the expression of IL-23 p19 was not decreased by PP2. Cytokine assays, indeed, showed that inhibition of Src kinases in human DC stimulated with TLR agonists alone or simultaneously resulted in a dramatic unbalance in the production of IL-12 and IL-23 :since IL-12 impairment was associated to a normal production of IL-23. Moreover the finding that IL-23 is not affected by PP2 treatment was also confirmed in a murine system of Bone Marrow derived Dendritic Cells stimulated with TLR agonists. Real-time qPCR in human MoDC showed that mRNA levels for IL-23A subunit exactly correlated with IL-23 cytokine levels suggesting that the IL-23A chain is the limiting component for the production of a complete IL-23 complex. Moreover,  transcriptional analysis showed that the role of Src kinases on specific transcription factors accounts for unbalanced IL-12/IL-23 production.

We will investigate if normal IL-23 production associated to inhibition of IL-12 observed upon stimulation of PP2-treated MoDC would result in a milieu able to induce a Th17 response. Eventually we will evaluate if src kinase inhibitors are able to modulate in-vivo the type of DC driven immune response.""" ;

Unlike in other species, the establishment of primary equine melanoma cultures that could be used to develop new therapeutic approaches has remained a major challenge. The purpose of the study was to develop a protocol for routine isolation and cultivation of primary equine melanocytes. Melanoma tissues were excised from 13 horses under local anesthesia, mainly from the perianal area. The melanoma cells were isolated from the melanoma tissue by serial enzymatic digestion using dispase and collagenase. Out of the 13 excised melanomas, cell cultures from eight melanomas were established, which corresponded to a success rate 62%. These cells showed different degrees of melanin pigmentation. Characterization of these cells using confocal microscopy, FACs analysis and western blotting showed that they expressed melanoma-associated antigens; Melan-A, MAGE-1, and MAGE-3, and PCNA expression was higher in fast-proliferating isolates. The protocol we developed and established proved successful for routine isolation and cultivation of primary equine melanoma cells. This method provided a large number of primary equine melanoma cells that could be used to study new therapeutic approaches for treatment of equine melanomas." ;

These results imply the presence of unique helper T (Th) cell functions in these animals. To identify and describe these cells, we first determined the presence of antigen-activated lymphocytes in AC tumor-bearing mice, as well as mice that received tumor cells subconjunctivally (SC), as measured by proliferative responses of lymphocytes from draining lymph nodes and spleens. In addition, we examined the lymphokine secretion profiles [interleukin (IL) 2, IL 4] of antigen-responsive lymph node and spleen cells in limiting dilution analysis. We found that lymphoid organs of mice primed by the SC route contained high frequencies of antigen-reactive CD4+ cells that secreted IL 2 only, or IL 2 plus IL 4. In addition, IL 2-secreting CD8+ cells were found. Alternatively, the lymphoid organs of mice receiving AC inoculations of P815 cells contained CD4+ as well as CD8+ cells that secreted IL 2 after antigen stimulation. However, no IL 4-secreting cells were found. According to a recent model of differentiation of CD4+ T cells, precursors of Th cells (that secrete IL 2 alone) differentiate into Th0 cells that can secrete IL 2, IL 4 and IFN-gamma. These cells further differentiate into Th1 cells and Th2 cells that secrete IL 2 or IL 4, respectively. We interpret the absence of IL 4-secreting CD4+ cells in AC tumor bearing mice to mean that in these mice precursor Th cells are unable/prevented from differentiating into Th0 cells." ;

Survivin and XIAP overexpression were detected in 36.7% and 43.3% of cases, respectively. Patients with overexpression of either survivin or XIAP showed unfavorable response to chemotherapy in 81.2% and 91.7%, respectively. Also, these cases showed shorter median survival time (30 days) compared to patients with normal expression of either survivin or XIAP (150 days and 180 days). Patients with overexpression of both survivin and XIAP showed unfavorable response to induction therapy in 100% of the patients and the shortest median survival (30 days).

Mechanisms of macrophage attraction and differentiation to a tumor-promoting phenotype, defined among others by distinct cytokine patterns such as pronounced interleukin (IL-10) production, are ill-defined. We aimed to identify signaling pathways that contribute to the generation of TAM-like macrophages using an adenoviral RNAi-based approach. Primary human monocyte-derived macrophages were stimulated with apoptotic tumor cell supernatants (ACM) to induce a TAM-like phenotype, characterized by secretion of IL-10, IL-6, IL-8 but repression of IL-12. For the high-throughput screen, macrophages were transduced with 8495 constructs of the adenoviral shRNA SilenceSelect(®) library of Galapagos BV, which aims at identifying druggable targets. We identified 96 genes involved in IL-10 production in response to ACM and observed a pronounced cluster of targets regulating both IL-10 and IL-6. Validation of five targets within the IL-10/IL-6 cluster was performed using siRNA or pharmacological inhibitors in human primary macrophages. Among those, interleukin 4 receptor-α and cannabinoid receptor 2 were confirmed as regulators of IL-10 and IL-6 secretion by ACM-stimulated macrophages. Our approach characterizes cellular functions of transfection-resistant, highly plastic and versatile cells and identifies novel targets involved in the generation of a TAM-like phenotype in human macrophages." ;

DC present peripheral Ags to T cells in lymph nodes, but also influence their differentiation (tolerance/immunity, Th1/Th2). To investigate how peripheral conditions affect DC properties and might subsequently regulate T cell differentiation, we examined the effects of a potent DC-activating, TLR-4-mediated stimulus, LPS, on rat intestinal and hepatic DC in vivo. Our results suggest that any explanation of switching between tolerance and immunity as well as involving changes in DC activation status must also take into account differential migration of DC subsets.""" ;

The tolerant state was confirmed by prolonged acceptance of donor-type skin grafts, and in vitro unresponsiveness to donor antigens. From the early stage of tolerant state, V beta 11+ or V beta 5+ T cells expressing CD4 or CD8 accessory molecules were markedly decreased in the periphery of the tolerant mice. Moreover, neither CD4+CD8- nor CD4-CD8+ thymocytes bearing a high density of V beta 11 or V beta 5 were detected in the chimeric thymus. The intrathymic clonal deletion appeared to be maintained in some of the recipient mice even after the disappearance of detectable mixed chimerism in the late stage. These results suggest that the mechanisms of the CP-induced tolerance include the destruction of the IE (and probably H-2D) reactive T cells in the periphery followed by the intrathymic clonal deletion of T cells reactive against these antigens. These results directly show the strong correlation between transplantation tolerance to H-2 alloantigens and the disappearance of alloreactive T cells in both the periphery and thymus." ;

(i) the transcriptional regulation of DC differentiation, and 
(ii) the safe and rationale in vitro manipulation of gene expression in DCs. 

One of the two different approaches that have been set up in parallel is: 

Transient transfection of synthetic siRNA: to this aim, commercially available siRNA Smart Pool from Dharmacon targeted against the STAT3 transcription factor have been successfully transfected in human MDDCs (Lipofectamine 2000 as transfection reagent). The efficiency of silencing, as detected by western blot or FACS analysis of the protein was of 50-80% (depending on the donor), and peaked at 72 h post-transfection. Transfection efficiency was reproducibly higher than 80% and did not induce any type I IFN production. A total of 9  different donors have been transfected under these optimized conditions and a detailed analysis of the phenotypic and functional consequences of STAT3 silencing have been performed upon 

(a) Toll-like receptor (TLR) mediated DC activation (e.g LPS or pI:C) and 
(b) activation in a tolerogenic microenvironment (e.g. combined stimulation TLR-L + IL-10). 

In particular, we analysed the immunophenotype, the antigen up-take activity, the secretion of cytokines/chemokines, and the ability of silenced MDDCs to stimulate T cell allogenic proliferation in classical MLR assays. 

No consistent and reproducible differences in the immunophenotype and antigene uptake capability of both iMDDCs and TLR-matured MDDCs have been observed. Modest inhibitory effects have instead been observed in the production IL-10 and IL-6, whose biological activity is controlled through STAT3. We noticed, however, that the transfection itself caused a non specific activation of MDDCs (of variable extent from donor to donor) that rendered difficult the interpretation of the results (especially MLR).

Global microarrays were used to define differentially modulated genes in STAT3 silenced MDDCs versus control cells.""" ;

As part of this work, we have used microscopy to study the effect of Dectin-1 uptake on its ability to signal for downstream responses. Finally, we have shown that fluorescently-labelled antibodies against a novel C-type lectin, DNGR-1, can be used to mark DC upon injection into mice and might therefore be useful for in vivo imaging studies.

Microscopy will continue to be used to understand molecular dynamics in cell biology and immunology, including studies of signalling pathways in dendritic cells. In particular, we are using imaging approached to define the endocytic ability of DNGR-1 and its ability to intersect with antigen processing compartments. We are also creating knock-in and transgenic reporter mice in which specific mouse DC subsets are  marked with fluorescent proteins for in vivo imaging studies.""" ;

The C-type lectin L-SIGN is expressed on liver and lymph node endothelial cells,where it serves as a receptor for a variety of carbohydrate ligands, including ICAM-3, Ebola, and HIV. To consider targeting liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (L-SIGN) for therapeutic purposes in autoimmunity and infectious disease, we isolated and characterized Fabs that bind strongly to L-SIGN, but to a lesser degree or not at all to dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN). As a first step to consider the potential of these Abs for Ab-mediated Ag delivery, we evaluated specific peptide delivery to human dendritic cells. A durable human T cell response was induced when a tetanus toxide epitope embedded into a L-SIGN/DC-SIGN-cross-reactive Ab was targeted to dendritic cells. We believe that the isolated Abs may be useful for selective delivery of Ags to DC-SIGN- or L-SIGN-bearing APCs for the modulation of immune responses and for blocking viral infections.""" ;

The tumor was composed of polygonal cells with mildly eosinophilic to clear cytoplasm and a rich vascular network. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a typical profile (positivity for α-inhibin, neuron-specific enolase and S100; negative results for epithelial membrane antigen, HMB-45, and Melan-A), which confirmed the diagnosis. Despite the similarity to renal-cell carcinoma in morphology, hemangioblastoma of the kidney is clinically indolent.

The mechanisms that ensure the balance of proinflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory cytokine production are of particular importance. As an active α- and β-adrenergic agonist, ephedrine hydrochloride (EH) is a widely used agent for cardiovascular diseases, especially boosting blood pressure. Here we demonstrate that EH increased Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated production of interleukin 10 (IL-10) through p38 MAPK activation. Simultaneously, EH negatively regulated the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Consistently, EH increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced serum IL-10 and inhibited tumor necrotic factor-α (TNFα) production in vivo. As a result, EH treatment protected mice from endotoxic shock by lethal LPS challenge. In brief, our data demonstrated that EH could contribute to immune homeostasis by balancing the production of proinflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory cytokine in TLR4 signaling. This study provides a potential usage of EH in autoimmunologic diseases or other severe inflammations." ;

      rdfs:comment """We obtained data from a trial in small cohorts of patients (3-9) who were vaccinated with differently composed DC-vaccines: 

DC loaded with a single MAA-derived peptide (MAGE-3.A1 or -A2 or Na17.A2) or pulsed with 2 to 3 MAA-derived peptides (combinations of MAGE-3.A2, MAGE-C2.A2 or Na17.A2) or G4-DC loaded with 8 different peptides. 

Our experiences can be summarized as follows: 
(1) preparation of an autologous dendritic cell based vaccine was feasible for every patient enrolled in our studies; 
(2) we did not observe vaccination related toxicities beside mild local skin reactions (CTCAEv3.0 grade 1/2) at the injection sites; 
(3) objective tumor regression was observed in 4 patients (1 CR and 1 CR after resection of residual disease following regression of metastases) on a total of 10 patients that were able to receive the planned 6 biweekly vaccinations; 
(4) all patients with regression of melanoma lesions following vaccination were found to have mounted a significant increase in the frequency of vaccine specific CTL in their peripheral blood and the appearance of a measurable CTL-frequency was seen between 8-13w after the first vaccine, furthermore, regression or stabilization of metastases has been coincident with the appearance of detectable or a significant rise (>10-fold) of CTL-frequencies; 
(5) 2 patients with no residual disease following surgical metastasectomy who were vaccinated remain disease free at >18 months of follow-up, one of these patients qualifies for a CTL-response, the other for a borderline response; 
(6) CTL-responses have been observed in 1 out of 3 patients treated with a mRNA-G4DC vaccine; this small number of patients does not allow for a comparison of efficacy between mRNA and MAA-peptide pulsed DC-vaccines.  

An important conclusion that can be made from these pilot-observations is that the potential therapeutic effect of our DC-based MAA-vaccination approach does not occur instantly but is delayed by 8-12w following the first vaccination (i.e.12-16w after the isolation of PBMC by leukapheresis given the 4w that are necessary for preparation of the DC-vaccine and the extensive quality control).  All patients in whom a benefit was seen in our study had a normal LDH and all but one patient, were chemo-naïve. """ ;

After the times indicated, supernatants were collected and cytokine detection was performed. MesoScale Assay 7-spot (Meso Scale Discovery) or Luminex® Assay (Invitrogen) were used for detection of IL-1beta, IL-8, IL-6, TNFalpha, IL-10, IL-12p70, IFNg and IL-17A according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
These procedures allowed simultaneously measurement of different cytokines in the same supernatants. The multiplex assay format differs from conventional ELISA in one significant way: the multiplex capture antibody is attached to a polystyrene bead whereas the ELISA capture antibody is attached to the microplate well. The use of the suspension bead-based technology enables multiplexing. Microspheres are internally dyed with red and infrared fluorophores of differing intensities. Each bead is given a unique number, or bead region, allowing differentiation of one bead from another. Beads covalently bound to different antibodies can be mixed in the same assay, utilizing a 96-well microplate format.
At the completion of the sandwich immunoassay, beads were read, using the Bioplex® 200™ detection system, in single-file by dual lasers for classification and quantification of each analyte. 
Alternatively, ELISA assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ELISA kits were from Biosource rather than ELISA for IL-12p70 that was from R&D System and IL-17 from e-Bioscience.
In blocking experiment, after 2 hors of exposure with the inhibitor, supernatants were collected after 8 or 24 hours or for T cell cytokine detection, 5 days of incubation.""" ;

As an example application, we use the method to screen thermally annealed poly(3-hexylthiophene):phenyl-C(61)-butyric acid methyl ester photovoltaic devices under realistic testing conditions over a technologically relevant performance window. We show that variations in device efficiency and nanoscale transient charging behavior are correlated, thereby linking local dynamics with device behavior.

Using curdlan as a specific agonist of dectin-1, we have shown that this C-type lectin couple to Syk kinase leads to activation of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPKs, as well as NF-kappaB. However, signalling terminates rapidly once the receptor is internalised, thereby explaining previous observations that large, non-phagocytisable Dectin-1 ligands are much more potent agonists than smaller ones.

This is the first example of a bona fide signalling pathway from a cell surface innate receptor other than a TLR. 

We will continue to study innate signalling pathways in dendritic cells. Our focus will be on TLR-independent signalling pathways involved in viral recognition, including RIG-I and MDA5, as well as signalling via C-type lectins related to Dectin-1, such as Dectin-2 and DNGR-1.""" ;

This is important and essential for implementation of the technology into clinical immune monitoring in e.g. vaccination trials.

Moreover, the affect of stimulation length was determined. Differences with respect to the induced frequencies of antigen-specific, activated CD154+ Th-cells were minor. Interestingly, longer stimulation times (16h) were characterised by a slightly reduced coefficient of variation. However, longer stimulation times resulted also in slightly enhanced background, implying that overnight stimulations cannot be performed when low frequencies of antigen-specific Th-cells are expected (Meier, Stark et al., 2008).

      dc:description "Yeast Pichia pastoris has been widely utilized to express heterologous recombinant proteins. P. pastoris expressed recombinant porcine interleukin 3 (IL3) has been used for porcine stem cell mobilization in allo-hematopoietic cell transplantation models and pig-to-primate xeno-hematopoietic cell transplantation models in our lab for many years. Since the yeast glycosylation mechanism is not exactly the same as those of other mammalian cells, P. pastoris expressed high-mannose glycoprotein porcine IL3 has been shown to result in a decreased serum half-life. Previously this was avoided by separation of the non-glycosylated porcine IL3 from the mixture of expressed glycosylated and non-glycosylated porcine IL3. However, this process was very inefficient and lead to a poor yield following purification. To overcome this problem, we engineered a non-N-glycosylated version of porcine IL3 by replacing the four potential N-glycosylation sites with four alanines. The codon-optimized non-N-glycosylated porcine IL3 gene was synthesized and expressed in P. pastoris. The expressed non-N-glycosylated porcine IL3 was captured using Ni-Sepharose 6 fast flow resin and further purified using strong anion exchange resin Poros 50 HQ. In vivo mobilization studies performed in our research facility demonstrated that the non-N-glycosylated porcine IL3 still keeps the original stem cell mobilization function." ;

It was created from the merger of the Department of Clinical Immunology at the Motol Teaching Hospital and the Institute of Immunology of the Second Medical Faculty into a single institution active in health care and teaching. Since 1995, the Institute of Immunology underwent many changes in terms of the organization of its activities, a significant expansion of its health care and teaching components and an intensifying of its research activities. The Institute is awarded research grants from the Ministries of Education a Health and International EU grants. Employees of the institute published many original articles in renowned journals and are authors of textbooks and monographs. At present, the Institute is one of the most significant immunology workplaces in the Czech Republic; it plays an important role through the cooperation with other departments of the Motol Teaching Hospital in the diagnosis and treatment of primary immunodeficiencies, autoimmune disorders and leukemia primarily in children. Successful developments in the field of cancer immunology based on the research into tumour vaccines on the basis of dendritic cells. In 2003, the Institute was recognized as a workplace fulfilling the requirements of the American Federation of Societies for Clinical Immunology (FOCIS) and became part of the international chain of Centers for Clinical Immunology.

* Immunotherapy
Research Aim: Long term goal of the group of tumor immunotherapy is the development of dendritic cell based cancer vaccine. Administration of this vaccine should induce tumor cell-specific induce response and contribute to current treatment options. Dendritic cells represent the most efficient antigen presenting cells as they activate primary immune response. Protocols developed in 1990s allow for generation of large numbers of dendritic cells from monocytes circulating in peripheral blood. Dendritic cell biology and their use in the immunotherapy of tumors have been studied at the Institute of Immunology for more than 10 years as documented by the list of publications . In collaboration with renowned European laboratories, we develop protocols for dendritic cell-based vaccines for the treatment of ovarian cancer, prostate cancer and for patients with hematological malignancies. First step of vaccine development is generation of large numbers of denritic cells from patient's monocytes. Dendritic cells are then incubated with various forms of tumor antigens, activated and subsequently administered to patients in defined vaccination programs. Cancer vaccine generation has to be done under strictly aseptic conditions. In 2007, University hospital Motol built a Cell therapy unit, first unit in Czech republic that allows for generation of clinical grade products for cellular therapy, including cancer vaccines. 

Principal Investigators prof. Jirina Bartunková, M.D., Ph.D., MBA., Radek Špíšek, M.D., Ph.D. 

Financial support: Research of dendritic cells at the Institute of Immunology, Charles University, 2nd Medical School has been supported by grants from Ministry of Education, grant agencies, grants form European Union.

      dc:description "Prostaglandin I(2) (PGI(2)) analog is regarded as a potential candidate for treating asthma. Human myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) play a critical role in the pathogenesis of asthma. However, the effects of PGI(2) analog on human myeloid DCs (mDCs) are unknown. In the present study, circulating mDCs were isolated from six healthy subjects. The effects of PGI(2) analogs, iloprost and treprostinil, on cytokine production, maturation and T cell stimulatory function of human mDCs were investigated. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-10 were measured by ELISA. The expression of costimulatory molecules were investigated by flow cytometry. T cell stimulatory function was investigated by measuring interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-13 and IL-10 production by T cells cocultured with iloprost-treated mDCs. Intracellular signaling was investigated by Western blot and chromatin immunoprecepitation. We found that iloprost and treprostinil induced IL-10, but suppressed TNF-α production in polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C)-stimulated mDCs. This effect was reversed by the I-prostanoid (IP), E-prostanoid (EP) receptor antagonists or intracellular free calcium (Ca(2+)) chelator. Forskolin, an adenyl cyclase activator, conferred a similar effect. Iloprost and treprostinil increased intracellular cAMP levels, and iloprost also increased intracellular Ca(2+). Iloprost suppressed poly I:C-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phospho-p38 and phospho-ATF2 expression. Iloprost down-regulated poly I:C-induced histone H3K4 trimethylation in the TNFA gene promoter region via suppressing translocation of H3K4 specific methyltransferases, MLL and WDR5. Iloprost-treated mDCs inhibited IL-13, IFN-γ and IL-10 production by T cells. In conclusion, PGI(2) analogs enhance IL-10 and suppress TNF-α expression through the IP/EP2/EP4 receptors-cAMP and EP1 receptor-Ca(2+) pathway. Iloprost suppressed TNF-α expression via the MAPK-p38-ATF2 pathway and epigenetic regulation by down-regulation of histone H3K4 trimethylation." ;

      dc:description "OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary complications are frequent during acute pancreatitis (AP). We investigate the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on lung injury in mild and severe AP. ANIMALS AND TREATMENT: Mild and severe AP was induced in rats by bile-pancreatic duct obstruction (BPDO) and infusion of 3.5 % sodium taurocholate (NaTc) into the bile-pancreatic duct, respectively. NAC (50 mg/kg) was given 1 h before and 1 h after AP. METHODS: Amylase activity was measured in plasma. Lungs were harvested for mRNA expression analysis of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC), P-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and histological examination. RESULTS: Hyperamylasemia was reduced by NAC in both AP models. NAC down-regulated MCP-1, CINC and P-selectin in BPDO- but not in NaTc-induced AP. Pulmonary insults did not vary in mild AP and were exacerbated in severe AP by NAC treatment. NAC reduced lung MPO activity in mild but not in severe AP. CONCLUSIONS: Although NAC treatment down-regulated inflammatory mediators in lungs during AP it did not prevent leukocyte infiltration, which could be responsible for maintaining the lung injury. As a result, NAC aggravated the lung damage in severe AP and failed to exert beneficial effects in the mild disease model." ;

These results provide evidence that sialoglycoprotein patterns are not determined exclusively by the transcription of biosynthetic enzymes or the availability of N-glycan sequons; instead, bulk metabolic flux through the sialic acid pathway has a remarkable ability to increase the abundance of certain sialoglycoproteins while having a minimal impact on others. Specifically, of 82 glycoproteins identified through a mass spectrometry and bioinformatics approach, ~31% showed no change in sialylation, ~29% exhibited a modest increase, while ~40% experienced an increase of greater than 2-fold. Increased sialylation of specific glycoproteins resulted in changes to the adhesive properties of SW1990 pancreatic cancer cells (e.g., increased CD44-mediated adhesion to selectins under physioloigcal flow and enhanced integrin-mediated cell mobility on collagen and fibronectin). These results indicate that cancer cells can become more aggressively malignant by controlling the sialylation of proteins implicated in metastatic transformation via metabolic flux." ;

      dc:description "BACKGROUND: Clinical application of adoptive T cell therapy has been hindered by an inability to generate adequate numbers of nontolerized, functionally active, tumor-specific T cells, which can persist in vivo. In order to address this, we evaluated the impact of interleukin (IL)-12 signaling during tumor-specific CD8(+) T cell priming in terms of persistence and antitumor efficacy using an established B16 melanoma tumor adoptive therapy model. STUDY DESIGN: B6 mice were injected subcutaneously with B16 melanoma tumor cells. On day 12 of tumor growth, mice were preconditioned with cyclophosphamide (4mg dose, intraperitoneally), and 1 day later were treated by adoptive transfer of tumor-specific pmel-1 CD8(+) T cells primed ex vivo 3 days earlier with both IL-12 and antigen (hGP100(25-33) peptide) or antigen only. Tumors were measured biweekly, and infused donor T cells were analyzed for persistence, localization to the tumor, phenotype, and effector function. RESULTS: Adoptive transfer of tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells primed with IL-12 was significantly more effective in reducing tumor burden in mice preconditioned with cyclophosphamide compared with transfer of T cells primed without IL-12. This enhanced antitumor response was associated with increased frequencies of infused T cells in the periphery and tumor as well as elevated expression of effector molecules including granzyme B and interferon-γ (IFNγ). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that ex vivo priming of tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells with IL-12 dramatically improves their in vivo persistence and therapeutic ability on transfer to tumor-bearing mice. These findings can be directly applied as novel clinical trial strategies." ;

      dc:description "HemaMax, a recombinant human interleukin-12 (IL-12), is under development to address an unmet medical need for effective treatments against acute radiation syndrome due to radiological terrorism or accident when administered at least 24 hours after radiation exposure. This study investigated pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of m-HemaMax (recombinant murine IL-12), and HemaMax to increase survival after total body irradiation (TBI) in mice and rhesus monkeys, respectively, with no supportive care. In mice, m-HemaMax at an optimal 20 ng/mouse dose significantly increased percent survival and survival time when administered 24 hours after TBI between 8-9 Gy (p<0.05 Pearson's chi-square test). This survival benefit was accompanied by increases in plasma interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and erythropoietin levels, recovery of femoral bone hematopoiesis characterized with the presence of IL-12 receptor β2 subunit-expressing myeloid progenitors, megakaryocytes, and osteoblasts. Mitigation of jejunal radiation damage was also examined. At allometrically equivalent doses, HemaMax showed similar pharmacokinetics in rhesus monkeys compared to m-HemaMax in mice, but more robustly increased plasma IFN-γ levels. HemaMax also increased plasma erythropoietin, IL-15, IL-18, and neopterin levels. At non-human primate doses pharmacologically equivalent to murine doses, HemaMax (100 ng/Kg and 250 ng/Kg) administered at 24 hours after TBI (6.7 Gy/LD(50/30)) significantly increased percent survival of HemaMax groups compared to vehicle (p<0.05 Pearson's chi-square test). This survival benefit was accompanied by a significantly higher leukocyte (neutrophils and lymphocytes), thrombocyte, and reticulocyte counts during nadir (days 12-14) and significantly less weight loss at day 12 compared to vehicle. These findings indicate successful interspecies dose conversion and provide proof of concept that HemaMax increases survival in irradiated rhesus monkeys by promoting hematopoiesis and recovery of immune functions and possibly gastrointestinal functions, likely through a network of interactions involving dendritic cells, osteoblasts, and soluble factors such as IL-12, IFN-γ, and cytoprotectant erythropoietin." ;

      dc:description "Insect chitinases are a multigene family that is encoded by a rather large and diverse group of genes. The main function of chitinases is to digest the chitin contained in tissues such as the cuticles and gut lining during molting. In this study, we examined the role of a chitinase (SeChi) and a bacterial type chitinase (SeChi-h) during the pupation and eclosion stages of Spodoptera exigua. First, efficient silencing of the SeChi and SeChi-h genes through specific double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) injection led to a significant reduction in the mRNA levels of SeChi and SeChi-h. Additionally, different phenotypic defects were observed at the pupal and adult stages after injection of the SeChi and SeChi-h dsRNAs. After injecting SeChi dsRNA in the pupal stage, the cuticle of the head split open and the pupal cuticle was visible under the old larval cuticle. However, after injecting the SeChi-h dsRNA, animals died without exhibiting any special phenotypes. At the adult death stage, animals injected with dsSeChi could not shed their pupal shell completely, and their old cuticles remained attached to their head or chest. However, the main lethal phenotype was that insects did not emerge after dsSeChi-h injection. Additionally, the average survival rates of S. exigua were 52.02% and 40.38% at the pupal and adult stages, respectively, after injection with SeChi dsRNA. For the insects injected with SeChi-h dsRNA, the survival rates were 72.38% and 48.52%, respectively. These results suggest that SeChi and SeChi-h may have different biologic functions during the pupal-adult molting." ;

We have assessed HBHA-specific intracellular IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-17 production by CD4(+) T-cells in TB cases and household contacts (HHC) as well as the level of secreted IFN-γ in whole blood culture supernatant. HHC were further classified as tuberculin skin test (TST) positive or negative and the group was also divided as HIV positive or negative. Our study revealed that HBHA induces multifunctional IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-17 co-expressing CD4(+) T-cells in HHC but not in active TB cases, however, IFN-γ levels in culture supernatant did not differ between participant groups. Further studies are needed to completely understand how HBHA induces immune responses in different disease groups." ;

      dc:description "Apoptotic cells are quickly recognized and engulfed by phagocytes to prevent the release of noxious materials from dying cells. Phosphatidylserine (PS) exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells is a proposed \"eat-me\" signal for the phagocytes. Transmembrane protein 16F (TMEM16F), a membrane protein with eight transmembrane segments, has the Ca-dependent phospholipid scramblase activity. Here we show that when lymphoma cells were transformed with a constitutively active form of TMEM16F, they exposed a high level of PS that was comparable to that observed on apoptotic cells. The PS-exposing cells were morphologically normal and grew normally. They efficiently responded to interleukin 3 and underwent apoptosis upon treatment with Fas ligand. The viable PS-exposing cells bound to peritoneal macrophages at 4 °C, but not at 25 °C. Accordingly, these cells were not engulfed by macrophages. When apoptotic cells were injected i.v. into mice, they were phagocytosed by CD11c(+)CD8(+) dendritic cells (DCs) in the spleen, but the PS-exposing living cells were not phagocytosed by these DCs. Furthermore, when PS-exposing lymphoma cells were transplanted s.c. into nude mice, they generated tumors as efficiently as parental lymphoma cells that did not expose PS. These results indicated that PS exposure alone is not sufficient to be recognized by macrophages as an eat-me signal." ;

This procedure allowed to obtain highly pure fractions of each subset. However, because DC are a very rare population, this method is very material- and cost-intensive. Furthermore, it is not surprising that the obtained cell numbers of each subset after isolation are below 107. However, these cell numbers should be sufficient for proteomic investigations. The proteomes of all three subsets using mass spectrometry is in progress." ;

We have identified that IL-10 plays an early and transient role in the control of the immune response to MTb and now show that this involves enhanced migration of IFNgamma producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells into the lung rather than enhanced mycobacterial killing. The effects are accompanied by enhanced G-CSF, GM-CSF, TNF, IL-6 and IL-17 levels although the enhanced clearance of bacilli in IL-10 deficient mice we now show is independent of IL-17." ;

The mass was initially diagnosed as an invasive, poorly differentiated carcinoma; however, on further review and immunohistochemical workup, the diagnosis of signet-ring cell melanoma was made. The lesion consisted of oval to round epithelioid cells undermining the gastric mucosa and infiltrating the muscularis mucosae. Tumor cells demonstrated abundant cytoplasm and eccentrically located nuclei, many with signet-ring cell morphology. The tumor cells were negative for mucin and pancytokeratin, strongly positive for S100 protein and Melan-A, and focally but strongly positive for human melanoma black-45. Diagnostic imaging failed to prove another site of melanoma, and no history of melanoma or cutaneous lesion was reported by the patient. Therefore, it was determined this was likely a primary lesion. We review the literature and previously reported cases of this rare histologic variant of melanoma." ;

      dc:description "Rapid amelioration of hypercholesterolemia in nephrotic syndrome (NS) using low density lipoprotein-apheresis (LDL-A) sometimes leads to NS remission, along with improvement of impaired biodefense system; however, the mechanism of how LDL-A affects NS is still unknown. We studied IFN-γ production under IL-12 stimulation for 24 h in whole blood from 30 NS patients, 31 non-NS patients, 35 healthy volunteers and another four persistent NS patients due to refractory focal segmental glomerulonephritis and minimal change type nephrotic syndrome. We compared IFN-γ production in whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from persistent NS patients before and after each of 14 LDL-A procedures. Finally, we studied the effect that persistent NS patients' serum before and after LDL-A had on IFN-γ production in healthy volunteers' PBMC. Whole blood IFN-γ production was significantly lower in NS patients compared with healthy volunteers or non-NS patients. In persistent NS, after LDL-A, IFN-γ production returned to normal levels. IFN-γ production in PBMC varied greatly among these patients and did not show consistent changes after LDL-A. Healthy volunteers PBMC incubated with persistent NS patients' serum obtained after LDLA showed higher IFN-γ production than before LDL-A. IFN-γ production in peripheral blood is impaired if a patient is in a nephrotic state. LDL-A might restore suppressed PBMC function in persistent NS patients, thereby ameliorating the nephrotic state, possibly through removing interfering serum factors." ;

      dc:description "The C57BL/6J mice strain is known to be reputedly resistant to induction of experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), an animal model of Guillain-Barré syndrome in humans. Here we describe the induction of EAN in mice of the C57BL/6J background by transfer into naive syngeneic recipients bovine peripheral nerve myelin (BPM)-primed donor lymph node cells that had been stimulated in vitro with the bovine peripheral nervous system (PNS) myelin P2 protein peptide 57-81 followed by challenge with BPM, Freund's complete adjuvant and pertussis toxin. EAN was more severe, both clinically and histologically, and accompanied by extensive infiltration of inflammatory cells and demyelination in peripheral nerves when examined on day 30 after transfer of primed T cells from CD4- 8- mice into identical naive hosts than after transfer of cells from primed wild type, CD4-/- or CD8-/- mice to corresponding recipient animals. EAN in CD4-8- mice was also associated with elevated numbers of P2 peptide-reactive interferon-y (TFN-gamma) secreting cells and alphabeta T cells were present in lymph nodes and spleens. The data suggest that PNS myelin activated T cells from an EAN-resistant mice strain are capable of homing to the PNS. The expanded CD4-8- alphabeta T cells may have helper and effector functions, related to initiation of EAN in the CD4-8- mice. Lack of CD4+ and CD8+ expressing cells does not prevent the initiation of an autoimmune disease." ;

      dc:description "Stevioside, a noncaloric sweetener isolated from Stevia rebaudiana, exhibits anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects through interference of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B pathway. We investigated whether this anti-inflammatory property of stevioside could improve muscle regeneration following cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury. Adult male Wistar rats received stevioside orally at an accepted daily dosage of 10 mg kg(-1) for 7 days before cardiotoxin injection at the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of the right hindlimb (the left hindlimb served as control), and stevioside administration was continued for 3 and 7 days. TA muscle was examined at days 3 and 7 postinjury. Although stevioside treatment had no significant effect in enhancing muscle regeneration as indicated by the absence of decreased muscle inflammation or improved myofibrillar protein content compared with vehicle treated injured group at day 7 postinjury, the number of MyoD-positive nuclei were increased (P < 0.05), with a corresponding decrease in NF-κB nuclear translocation (P < 0.05). This is the first study to demonstrate that stevioside could enhance satellite cell activation by modulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway in regenerating muscle following injury. Thus, stevioside may be beneficial as a dietary supplementation for promoting muscle recovery from injury. However, its pharmacological effect on muscle function recovery warrants further investigation." ;

      dc:description "Amyloid fibril formation is associated with a number of debilitating systemic and neurodegenerative diseases. One of the most prominent is Alzheimers disease in which aggregation and deposition of the Aβ peptide occurs. Aβ is widely considered to mediate the extensive neuronal loss observed in this disease through the formation of soluble oligomeric species, with the final fibrillar end-product of the aggregation process being relatively inert. Factors that influence the aggregation of these amyloid-forming proteins are therefore very important. We have screened a library of 96 amphipathic molecules for effects on Aβ1-42 aggregation and self-association. We find, using Thioflavin T fluorescence and electron microscopy assays, that 30 of the molecules inhibit the aggregation process, while 36 activate fibril formation. Several activators and inhibitors were subjected to further analysis using analytical ultracentrifugation and circular dichroism. Activators typically display a 1:10 peptide : detergent stoichiometry for maximal activation, while the inhibitors are effective at a 1:1 stoichiometry. Analytical ultracentrifugation and circular dichroism experiments show that activators promote a mixture of unfolded and β-sheet structures and rapidly form large aggregates, while inhibitors induce α-helical structures that form stable dimeric/trimeric oligomers. The results suggest that Aβ1-42 contains at least one small molecule binding-sites, which modulates the secondary structure and aggregation processes. Further studies of the binding of these compounds to Aβ may provide insight for developing therapeutic strategies aimed at stabilizing Aβ in a favourable conformation." ;

Lactobacillus casei cell wall extract was diluted to 1 mg/ml in PBS and administered to mice by intraperitoneal injection to establish a model of Kawasaki disease. Sixty female mice were used in this study, 40 of which were randomly assigned to a model (normal saline by gavage, n=20) or experimental group (200 mg/kg/day pachyman by gavage, n=20). The remaining 20 mice were disease and treatment-free, and were used as the control group. Compared to the control mice, mice in the model group exhibited a significantly lower percentage of CD4+CD25+ Tregs and significantly higher serum IL-4 and IFN-γ levels (P<0.05). However, CD4+CD25+ Tregs significantly increased and IL-4 and IFN-γ levels significantly decreased in experimental mice following pachyman treatment (P<0.05). Further analysis showed a negative correlation between CD4+CD25+ Tregs and IL-4/IFN-γ levels (P<0.05). In conclusion, pachyman improves immune function in a mouse model of Kawasaki disease by upregulating CD4+CD25+ Tregs, which may inhibit the cytokine secretion of Th1 and Th2 cells." ;

Surprisingly, instead of a single program of differentiation leading to the coordinated expression of all effector genes; we found that individual effector genes had different kinetics of expression and associated randomly generating several new effector cell types. These results are published in J. Exp. Med. Since these results were obtained in TCR-Tg mice, and thus could be different from those of normal cells, we initiated a long program comparing the behaviour of TCR-Tg cells specific for GP-33 peptide, with LCMV-specific populations: 

1) sharing the same GP33 specificity 
1a) present either in the same or 
1b) in normal mice; 

2) or other LCMV peptide specificities.

      dc:description "Mechanisms causing liver fibrosis during chronic hepatitis C virus infection (cHCV) are not sufficiently understood. This study was aimed to identify biomarkers for early fibrosis (EF) and to investigate their potential role in cHCV-related fibrogenesis. To this end, peripheral whole blood (PB) samples from 36 patients with cHCV recruited from two independent cohorts were subjected to microarray analysis 12 h before initiation of peginterferon-alpha (Peg-IFN-α) and ribavirin therapy. Liver biopsies were evaluated using the Batts-Ludwig staging (BL-S) classification system for fibrosis. We showed that gene expression profiles (N = 8) distinguished between EF (BL-S: 0,1) and late fibrosis (LF; BL-S: 2,3,4) with 88.9% accuracy. Fibrosis-related functional annotations for chemokine-'C-C-motif'' ligand 5 (CCL5) provided foundation for focused investigation, and qRT-PCR confirmed that CCL5 mRNA levels (PB) reliably discriminate EF from LF (accuracy: 86.7%). Positive correlations (P < 0.05) with CCL5 mRNA levels and EF discovered gene expression profiles (PB) reflecting stable expression of IFN-α receptor 1, negative regulation of the MyD88-dependent toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway and decreased expression of TLR3 in vivo. Remarkably, Peg-IFN-α suppressed CCL5 mRNA levels (PB) in EF in vivo. These findings along with results from parallel in vitro investigation into the effect of IFN-α or poly I:C (TLR3-agonist) on CCL5 gene expression in hepatic stellate cells (HSC) attest to the multi-site involvement of these pathways in regulating fibrogenesis. In conclusion, we identified novel, reliable biomarkers for EF and exposed functional properties of the molecular network regulating CCL5 biosynthesis in peripheral or hepatic cell types with key roles in cHCV-related liver and/or immune pathogenesis." ;

      dc:description "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a common cause of chronic diarrhoea in dogs. In people, specific cytokine patterns attributed to T cell subsets, especially T helper cell [Th]1, Th17 and regulatory T(reg) cells have emerged in IBD. In contrast, no specific involvement of a distinct T cell subset has been described so far in canine IBD. Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess gene expression of signature cytokines in duodenal tissues from 18 German shepherd dogs with IBD (group 1), 33 dogs of other breeds with IBD (group 2) and 15 control dogs (group 3). Relative quantification of IL-17A, IL-22, IL-10, IFNy and TGFβ was performed. Expression of IL-17A was significantly lower in groups 1 and 2 compared to group 3 (p=0.014), but no difference in the expression of IL-22 (p=0.839), IFNγ (p=0.359), IL-10 (p=0.085) or TGFβ (p=0.551) across groups was detected. Thus, no clear evidence for the involvement of Th-17 signature cytokines in canine IBD at the mRNA level could be shown. The contribution of specific T cell subsets to the pathogenesis of canine IBD warrants further investigation." ;

In vitro stimulation of nTregs with GITR ligand increased phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) or p38 MAP kinases. SP600125, a known JNK inhibitor, prevented GITR-mediated phosphorylation of JNK. Activation of JNK was associated with increases in the upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7) and the downstream transcription factor NF-κβ. Phosphorylated c-Jun (p-c-Jun), indicative of the activation of JNK, was detected in the immunoprecipitates of nTregs from wild-type but not JNK- or GITR-deficient mice. Treatment with an inhibitor of JNK phosphorylation resulted in complete reversal of all GITR-induced changes in nTreg phenotype and function, with full restoration of suppression of in vivo lung allergic responses and in vitro proliferation of activated CD4+CD25- T cells. Thus, regulation of JNK phosphorylation plays a central role in T regulatory cell function with therapeutic implications for the treatment of asthma and autoimmune diseases." ;

We focused on the monitoring of tumour antigen specific CD4+ T cell responses. We select the following tumour associated antigens: 
i) the E6 and E7 proteins of human papilloma viruses, 
ii) the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and 
iii) the tumour specific antigen MAGE-A3. 

We investigated spontaneous CD4+ T cell responses to these antigens in normal donors and in patients with high-grade cervical lesions, pancreas adenocarcinoma and advanced melanoma. HPV-18 E6 specific CD4+ T cells were found in a high percentage of patients with cervical lesions and we showed that the quality of the response (i.e. the level of IFN-? produced) could predict the clinical outcome after surgery. CEA specific CD4+ T cells were found both in normal donors and in patients but CD4+ T cells from the patients compared to normal donors showed impaired IFN-gamma production. MAGE-A3 specific CD4+ T cells were found also in a high percentage of melanoma patients but CD4+ T cells showed an unpolarized or Th2 skewed phenotype. We have optimized the MAGE-A3 peptides to load onto HLA-DR*1101 tetramers. """ ;

IE- B10.A(4R)(4R; Kk, IAk, IE-, Db) mice could not reject skin graft from IE Ag alone-disparate B10.A(2R) (2R; Kk, IAk, IEk, Db) mice despite intravenous (iv) injection of 2R spleen cells (SC) before or after skin grafting, indicating that graft rejection could not be caused across IE Ag-barrier alone. Furthermore, 4R SC could not induce lethal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in supralethally (950 rad) irradiated 2R mice. On the other hand, infiltration of lymphoid cells was observed at the site of transplanted 2R skin in 4R mice. SC of 4R mice unprimed or primed with 2R skin or 2R SC showed the capability to proliferate in vitro in response to 2R Ag. In immunofluorescence analysis of lymph node cells (LNC) of 4R mice injected iv with 2R SC 7 days earlier, IE-reactive CD4+Vbeta 11+ T cells did not change in number, but slightly increased the expression of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R). In 2R mice irradiated with 670 rad and injected iv with 4R SC 7 days earlier, 4R-derived CD4+V beta 11+ T cells proliferated, changed to blastoid form, and showed a markedly increased expression of IL-2R. To further investigate the influence of IE alloantigens on transplantation immunity, IL-2 production and anti-class I CTL activity were assayed. The 4R SC capable of recognizing IEk and Dk Ag of B10.BR (Kk, IAk, IEk, Dk) generated levels of both IL-2 and CTL activities higher than those of 2R SC capable of recognizing Dk Ag alone. These results strongly suggest that IE alloantigens indirectly act as the transplantation Ag by the stimulation of IE-reactive CD4+ helper T cells resulting in the differentiation of class I-restricted CD8+ T cells." ;

Structural works that have been performed to up-grade the GMP facility for conduction of phase III clinical trials has limited the number of patients recruited. Nonetheless, we were able to complete the vaccination schedule in 4 patients and to perform additional injections in disease free patients, in patients with stable disease or with slowly progressive disease. We could not recruit new patients because the generation in GMP conditions of additional aliquots of the vaccines (i.e. the supernatant containing the infective MAGE-3 encoding viruses and the natural tumour peptides) is taking longer then predicted because of new viral controls required by the Regulatory Agency and of difficulties in purchasing clinical grade dialysis’ membranes for peptides production. As far as the planning of new protocols concerns we are waiting to know whether grant applications we applied for the specific issues will be funded.

Thus so far the 2 clinical trials are on hold until problems in GMP production of the vaccine have been solved.""" ;

METHOD: A case-control study within the cross-sectional Akershus Sleep Apnea Project was performed. Two controls matched for age, gender, metabolic syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea were drawn for each case of MDD. RESULTS: Group comparisons revealed no significant difference in the levels of 17 cytokines [interleukin-1β, -2,-4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -10, -12(p70), -13 and -17; tumor necrosis factor-α; interferon-γ; granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor; macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 and monocyte inhibitory protein-1β] between persons with (n=34) and without MDD (n=68). There was no association between cytokines levels and MDD in multivariate regression analyses. The concentration of interleukin-4 was significantly more positively correlated with psychological than somatic symptoms (r=0.046 vs. -0.143, respectively, P=0.024), while no different correlations were observed for other cytokines. CONCLUSION: The cytokine levels were not elevated in MDD, and cytokine levels were not more strongly associated with somatic than psychological symptoms of depression. The depression-specific effect on inflammation may be weak in community-based samples with prevalent somatic comorbidity." ;

In the present study we propose a simple mechanism for the controlled detachment of C(2)C(12) myoblasts cell sheets from PEMs consisting of poly(l-lysine) and hyaluronic acid with a topmost layer of fibronectin. The multilayers were deposited on two standard cell culture surfaces: glass and polystyrene. Adding a low concentration of nontoxic ferrocyanide to the cell culture medium resulted in erosion of the polyelectrolyte multilayer and rapid detachment of viable cell sheets. Additional Quartz Crystal Microbalance and Atomic Force Microscopy measurements indicated that the detached cells retained their extracellular matrix and that no polyelectrolyte molecules remained bound to the cell sheets. The dissolution of polyelectrolyte multilayers by multivalent ions is a promising approach to cell sheet engineering that could potentially be used for regenerative medicine." ;

METHODS: Between July 31, 2008, and June 3, 2009, we enrolled patients with melanoma and brain metastases from ten US centres who were older than 16 years into two parallel cohorts. Patients in cohort A were neurologically asymptomatic and were not receiving corticosteroid treatment at study entry; those in cohort B were symptomatic and on a stable dose of corticosteroids. Patients were to receive four doses of 10 mg/kg intravenous ipilimumab, one every 3 weeks. Individuals who were clinically stable at week 24 were eligible to receive 10 mg/kg intravenous ipilimumab every 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with disease control, defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease after 12 weeks, assessed with modified WHO criteria. Analyses of safety and efficacy included all treated patients. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00623766. FINDINGS: We enrolled 72 patients: 51 into cohort A and 21 into cohort B. After 12 weeks, nine patients in cohort A exhibited disease control (18%, 95% CI 8-31), as did one patient in cohort B (5%, 0·1-24). When the brain alone was assessed, 12 patients in cohort A (24%, 13-38) and two in cohort B (10%, 1-30) achieved disease control. We noted disease control outside of the brain in 14 patients (27%, 16-42) in cohort A and in one individual (5%, 0·1-24) in cohort B. The most common grade 3 adverse events in cohort A were diarrhoea (six patients [12%]) and fatigue (six [12%]); in cohort B, they were dehydration (two individuals [10%]), hyperglycaemia (two [10%]), and increased concentrations of serum aspartate aminotransferase (two [10%]). One patient in each cohort had grade 4 confusion. The most common grade 3 immune-related adverse events were diarrhoea (six patients [12%]) and rash (one [2%]) in cohort A, and rash (one individual [5%]) and increased concentrations of serum aspartate aminotransferase (two [10%]) in cohort B. One patient in cohort A died of drug-related complications of immune-related colitis. INTERPRETATION: Ipilimumab has activity in some patients with advanced melanoma and brain metastases, particularly when metastases are small and asymptomatic. The drug has no unexpected toxic effects in this population. FUNDING: Bristol-Myers Squibb." ;

We examined the mechanisms of action of anti-CTLA4 and a GM-CSF-transduced tumor cell vaccine (Gvax) and their impact on the balance of effector T cells (Teffs) and Tregs in an in vivo model of B16/BL6 melanoma. Tumor challenge increased the frequency of Tregs in lymph nodes, and untreated tumors became infiltrated by CD4+Foxp3- and CD4+Foxp3+ T cells but few CD8+ T cells. Anti-CTLA4 did not deplete Tregs or permanently impair their function but acted in a cell-intrinsic manner on both Tregs and Teffs, allowing them to expand, most likely in response to self antigen. While Gvax primed the tumor-reactive Teff compartment, inducing activation, tumor infiltration, and a delay in tumor growth, the combination with CTLA4 blockade induced greater infiltration and a striking change in the intratumor balance of Tregs and Teffs that directly correlated with tumor rejection. The data suggest that Tregs control both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activity within the tumor, highlight the importance of the intratumor ratio of effectors to regulators, and demonstrate inversion of the ratio and correlation with tumor rejection during Gvax/anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy." ;

We propose the role of cell wall in the mechanisms of DC-Pathogen interaction as an experiment that could serve as reference in bioinformatics approaches for the reconstruction of DC activation signalling pathways. We have stimulated human Monocyte derived Dendritic Cells (hMoDC) with yeast, spheroplasts, pseudohyphae, spores, purified RNA and not purified RNA, LPS. We have measured IL-6, IL-8, TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IFNgamma, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-12p40. We are performing transcriptional analysis on the above mentioned samples, using the Genomics facilities at Genopolis (P32). The results are being analyzed with DC_Eu.Gene Analyzer and compared with other experiments in order to identify DC- and immunological pathway differentially affected by the different stimuli. 

We have collaborated actively with Ugo D'Oro, Giorgio Napolitani, Federica Sallusto and Antonio Lanzavecchia. This integration of efforts and information is instrumental to the fruition of the genomics information in the field of dendritic cells research. Regarding the knowledge portal, we submitted microarray data and SOPS on the above mentioned experiments. """ ;

Our objective was to evaluate endothelial function and markers of inflammation during and after pregnancy in normal pregnancies compared to pregnancies complicated with hypertension or preeclampsia (PE). Methods and Results. We measured endothelium-dependent brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) and high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in 32 women with normal pregnancy and in 28 women whose pregnancy was complicated with hypertensive disorder in the second half of pregnancy and minimum 3-month postpartum. Enhancement of endothelial function was greater in hypertensive than normal pregnancies, the mean FMD% being 11.0% versus 8.8% during pregnancy (P = 0.194) and 8.0% versus 7.9% postpartum (P = 0.978). Concentrations of markers of inflammation were markedly increased in pregnant hypertensive group compared to those after delivery (hsCRP 4.5 versus 0.80 mg/L, P = 0.023, IL-6 2.1 versus 1.2 pg/mL, P = 0.006; TNF-α 1.9 versus 1.5 pg/mL, P = 0.030). There were no statistically significant associations between the markers of inflammation and FMD. Conclusions. Brachial artery FMD was not attenuated in the third trimester hypertensive pregnancies compared to normal pregnancies, whereas circulating concentrations of hsCRP and IL-6 and TNF-α reacted to hypertensive complications." ;

In 2007, we have finalized analysis of the receptors on DCs responsible for capture of exosomes secreted by mature DCs. We have shown that expression of LFA-1, but not of Mac-1, integrin, on DCs is required for capture of ICAM-1-bearing exosomes. Furthermore, the CD8+ subpopulation of DCs in lymph nodes expresses LFA-1 at higher levels than the CD8- subpopulation, and is responsible for in vivo capture of injected exosomes. We have thus proposed a new role for LFA-1 on DCs, as a receptor to favor antigen transfer via exosomes in vivo. These results have been published in 2007 (Segura et al, JI)." ;

      rdfs:comment "The use of gene guns in ballistically delivering DNA vaccine coated gold micro-particles to skin can potentially damage targeted cells, including Langerhans cells, therefore influencing transfection efficiencies. We have assessed and obtained data on cell death in the viable epidermis by non-invasive near infrared two-photon microscopy following micro-particle bombardment of murine skin. We showed that the ballistic delivery of micro-particles to the viable epidermis can result in localised cell death. Furthermore, experimental results show the degree of cell death is dependant on the number of micro-particles delivered per unit of tissue surface area. These results suggest that optimization of transfection by genes administered with gene guns is - among other effects - a compromise of micro-particle payload and cell death. " ;

      rdfs:comment """Eu.Gene Analyzer is an easy-to-use, stand-alone application that allows rapid and powerful microarray data analysis in the context of biological pathways. Its intuitive graphical user interface makes it an easy and flexible tool, even for the first-time user. Eu.Gene supports a variety of array platforms, organisms and pathway ontologies, transparently deals with multiple nomenclature systems and seamlessly integrates data from different sources. Two different statistical methods, the Fisher Exact Test and the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), are implemented to identify biological pathways transcriptionally affected under experimental conditions. A suite of tools is offered to define, visualize and share custom non-redundant pathway sets. 

In conclusion, Eu.Gene Analyzer is a new software application that takes advantage of information from multiple pathway databases to build a comprehensive interpretation of experimental results in a simple, intuitive environment.

Meanwhile, we have developed a new version of EuGene,  EuGene 1.5,  now available for download from the new EuGene Website at www.duccioknights.org,which has several advantages:
a-Adds new functionality or optimize already present features to meet the requirements for DC-STUDIO. 
b-set up a method to convert pathway deregulation into a categorical value, the signed Binary Enrichment Factor (sBEF),  a three state variable (significantly up-regulated, significantly down-regulated and not significant) associated to each pathway of the curated pathway set for a particular sample. DC-STUDIO was engineered to store collections of sBEFs, as a sort of “barcodes”, for each sample analyzed, in a way that would be compatible with future integration with DC-BASE. """ ;

To improve existing strategies, the amplitude and polarisation of T cell responses was monitored in the presence or absence of regulatory T cells. Natural regulatory T cells (CD4+ CD25+) were depleted by injection of anti-CD25 mAbs, whereas regulatory T cells were induced by injection of (presumably agonistic) anti-CTLA-4 mAbs. Our observations demonstrate that natural and CTLA-4 induced regulatory T cells are distinct populations. Both cell types downregulate Th1-type responses, suggesting new strategies to optimize DC-based immunotherapy to induce tumor resistance. " ;

HIV causes a disseminated infection and spreads in all newly generated lymphoid tissues, thus closely resembling HIV infection in humans. However, as in EBV infected animals, adaptive T and B cell responses were not consistently detected.

Thus, although these “humanized” mice represent a major step forward in generating an in vivo preclinical testing system, they still harbor limitations as inconsistent/weak adaptive immune responses, questionable T (and B) cell selection, insufficient human hematopoietic stem cell maintenance, and myeloid cell constitution. To address these issues, we are now aiming to improve the recipient mouse background by co-transplanting human mesenchymal stroma cells, and by adding human cytokines as well as human MHC. Furthermore, we use the mice to evaluate targeted therapies directed at human immune system cells as T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells.""" ;

Human blood contains myeloid (mDCs) and plasmacytoid (pDCs) dendritic cells that differ in cytokine secretion pattern and responsiveness to microbial stimuli. We found that LPS-stimulated mDCs are able to induce up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules on co-cultured pDCs. Likewise, CpG-stimulated pDCs activate co-cultured mDCs. The cross talk between these two populations of DC is very efficient since it can be observed at mDC/pDC ratio ranging from 1/10 to 10/1. Activation of the co-cultured population is restricted to up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules since it does not involve cytokine secretion by the indirectly activated cells. The process is cell contact-dependent, although CD40-CD40L interaction is not involved, but it is also partly dependent on soluble factors. Indeed TNFa produced by LPS-activated mDCs plays a role in the activation of the co-cultured pDC. On the other hand type I interferons produced by CpG-activated pDCs is required for activation of the mDC. We also observed a strong synergistic response of both cell types, using limiting conditions of stimulus on co-cultured mDCs and pDCs. 

The study on the response of human MoDC to yeast, spheroplasts, pseudohyphae and spores was performed in collaboration with Duccio Cavalieri's group (partner 15). Analysis of IL-6, IL-8, TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IFNgamma, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-12p40 secretion was performed with a multiplex assay.
We will evaluate the capacity of MoDC stimulated by different forms of S. cerevisiae and Candida albicans to differentially induce T cell polarization.""" ;

The HBE16 cells were cultured with AR inhibitors (zopolrestat) or were transfected with an AR small interfering (si)RNA. Subsequently, the cells were stimulated with 10ng/ml IL-13 for 2h. The levels of mucin (MUC)5AC mRNA and protein were measured by using RT-PCR or ELISA. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured fluorimetrically with the CM-H2DCFDA probe. Western blotting was performed to determine the levels of AR, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (p-STAT6) and phosphorylated Janus kinase 2 (p-JAK2). The results show that treatment with zopolrestat or transfection with AR siRNA significantly suppressed IL-13-stimulated MUC5AC mRNA and protein in the HBE16 cells (P<0.05). AR inhibition could suppress IL-13-induced ROS generation, the phosphorylation of JAK2/STAT6 pathway and the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B, thereby decreasing mucus production in vitro (all P<0.05). Therefore, the inhibition of AR could be a therapeutic target for mucus hypersecretion in chronic inflammation lung disease." ;

The serum cytokine profile post immunization, as determined by flow cytometry bead based assay, showed a predominant T helper cell Type 1 (Th1) response with significant increase in levels of IFNγ and TNFα. Lethal challenge with T. evansi blood-form trypomastigotes post immunization generated a β tubulin specific recall response and a stronger Th1 type serum cytokine profile which correlated with an extended survival and better control of parasitemia in the immunized mice." ;

      rdfs:comment """We have obtained data on a possible cooperation between myeloid and plasmacytoid DCs in response to different microbial stimuli and a characterization of the mechanisms of this cooperation. For this, we have studied co-culture of mDCs and pDCs in response to CpGs, LPS and bacterial particles. 

Taking advantage on the fact that human myeloid and plasmacitoid DC show a selective response to LPS and CpG respectively, we have previously identified a cross-talk between two type of cells. Indeed it was observed that LPS-stimulated mDCs are able to induce up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules on co-cultured pDCs. Similarly, CpG-stimulated pDCs activate co-cultured mDCs. Activation of the co-cultured population was restricted to up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules and was partially cell contact-dependent. We have now investigated if co-operation between mDCs and pDCs is able to facilitate the induction of adaptive immunity in conditions of low stimulation, which can be encountered in the very early phase of a pathogen infection or in the presence of very low amounts of pathogen. In particular we analyzed if the synergy between mDCs and pDCs stimulated by their respective selective stimulus is important for increasing their ability at inducing T cell activation. Indeed we established that the mDC/pDC cross-talk has a functional effect on T cell activation. In fact the mDC/pDC cooperation event is able to significantly increase the ability of these cells to drive the proliferation and IFN? production by alloreactive T cells. In addition, we discovered that pDCs are not able to respond to whole fixed or live bacteria and consequently, these cells are incapable of phagocytosing   bacterial particles. These finding strongly suggest that pDCs is a cellular population that plays a very specialized antiviral function, although, through a cross-talk with mDC, it can also be indirectly recruited during a bacterial infection, synergizing in the induction of an adaptive immune response.

We will investigate the molecular mechanism through which a mDC/pDC cross-activation occurs. In particular, since the mDC/pDC cross-talk process that we identified is dependent on cell-contact events, we will try to identify the molecule/s responsible for cross-activation between mDCs and pDCs.

      dc:description "Dendritic cells (DCs), and especially plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), produce large amounts of IFN-α/β upon infections with DNA or RNA viruses, which impacts on the physiopathology of the viral infections and on the quality of the adaptive immunity. However little is known about the IFN-α/β production by DCs during infections by double stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses. We present here novel information about the production of IFN-α/β induced by Bluetongue virus (BTV), a vector-borne dsRNA Orbivirus of ruminants, in sheep primary DCs. We found that BTV induced IFN-α/β in skin lymph and in blood in vivo. Although BTV replicated in a substantial fraction of the conventional DCs (cDCs) and pDCs in vitro, only pDCs responded to BTV by producing a significant amount of IFN-α/β. BTV replication in pDCs was not mandatory for IFN-α/β production since it was still induced by UV-inactivated BTV (UV-BTV). Other inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-12p40, were also induced by UV-BTV in primary pDCs. The induction of IFN-α/β required endo/lysosomal acidification and maturation. However despite being an RNA virus, UV-BTV did not signal through TLR7 for IFN-α/β induction. In contrast, pathways involving the MyD88 adaptor, and the kinases PKR and SAPK/JNK were implicated. This work highlights the importance of pDCs for the production of innate immunity cytokines induced by a dsRNA virus and it shows that a dsRNA virus can induce IFN-α/β in pDCs via a novel TLR-independent and Myd88-dependent pathway. These findings have implications for the design of efficient vaccines against dsRNA viruses." ;

      dc:description "BACKGROUND: The neuroimmunologic effect of traumatic head injury remains ill-defined. This study aimed to characterize systemic cytokine profiles among traumatically injured patients to assess the effect of traumatic head injury on the systemic inflammatory response. STUDY DESIGN: For 5 years, 1,022 patients were evaluated from a multi-institutional Trauma Immunomodulatory Database. Patients were stratified by presence of severe head injury (SHI; head Injury Severity Score ≥4, n = 335) vs nonsevere head injury (NHI; head Injury Severity Score ≤3, n = 687). Systemic cytokine expression was quantified by ELISA within 72 hours of admission. Patient factors, outcomes, and cytokine profiles were compared by univariate analyses. RESULTS: SHI patients were more severely injured with higher mortality, despite similar ICU infection and ventilator-associated pneumonia rates. Expression of early proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6 (p < 0.001) and tumor necrosis factor-α (p = 0.02), was higher among NHI patients, and expression of immunomodulatory cytokines, interferon-γ (p = 0.01) and interleukin-12 (p = 0.003), was higher in SHI patients. High tumor necrosis factor-α levels in NHI patients were associated with mortality (p = 0.01), increased mechanical ventilation (p = 0.02), and development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (p = 0.01). Alternatively, among SHI patients, high interleukin-2 levels were associated with survival, decreased mechanical ventilation, and absence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of severe traumatic head injury significantly alters systemic cytokine expression and exerts an immunomodulatory effect. Early recognition of these profiles can allow for targeted intervention to reduce patient morbidity and mortality." ;

      dc:description "Hematopoietic processes, especially megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis, are highly sensitive to extracellular oxidative stresses such as ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic agents. This study examined the terminal maturation of megakaryocytes and platelet production in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) exposed to ionizing radiation. Highly purified CD34(+) cells derived from human placental/umbilical cord blood were exposed to X rays (2 Gy, 150 kVp, 20 mA; 0.5-mm aluminum and 0.3-mm copper filters) at a dose rate of approximately 1 Gy/min and then cultured in a serum-free medium supplemented with thrombopoietin and interleukin-3. The number of cells generated from X-irradiated CD34(+) cells decreased with the time in culture. However, the fraction of CD34(+)Tie-2(+) and CD41(+)Tie-2(+) cells among the total cells generated from X-irradiated cells increased significantly in comparison to nonirradiated controls on day 7. In addition, the CD42a(+) particles, which appeared to be platelets, generated from the X-irradiated HSPCs appeared to be normal. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of the expression of various genes in cells harvested from the cultures showed that the early hematopoiesis-related genes FLI1, HOXB4 and Tie-2, the cytokine receptor genes KIT and IL3RA, and the oxidative stress-related genes HO1 and NQO1 were upregulated on day 7. These results suggest that normal terminal maturation of megakaryocytes and platelet production occur in residual HSPCs after exposure to ionizing radiation despite the adverse effect of radiation on proliferation and differentiation of HSPCs. Ionizing radiation may have the potential to promote both megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis." ;

      dc:description "Although many human cancers such as melanoma express tumor antigens recognized by T cells, host immune responses often fail to control tumor growth for as yet unexplained reasons. Here, we found a strong association between melanocyte expression of B7-H1 (PD-L1), an immune-inhibitory molecule, and the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in human melanocytic lesions: 98% of B7-H1(+) tumors were associated with TILs compared with only 28% of B7-H1(-) tumors. Indeed, B7-H1(+) melanocytes were almost always localized immediately adjacent to TILs. B7-H1/TIL colocalization was identified not only in melanomas but also in inflamed benign nevi, indicating that B7-H1 expression may represent a host response to tissue inflammation. Interferon-γ, a primary inducer of B7-H1 expression, was detected at the interface of B7-H1(+) tumors and TILs, whereas none was found in B7-H1(-) tumors. Therefore, TILs may actually trigger their own inhibition by secreting cytokines that drive tumor B7-H1 expression. Consistent with this hypothesis, overall survival of patients with B7-H1(+) metastatic melanoma was significantly prolonged compared with that of patients with B7-H1(-) metastatic melanoma. Therefore, induction of the B7-H1/PD-1 pathway may represent an adaptive immune resistance mechanism exerted by tumor cells in response to endogenous antitumor activity and may explain how melanomas escape immune destruction despite endogenous antitumor immune responses. These observations suggest that therapies that block this pathway may benefit patients with B7-H1(+) tumors." ;

There are clinical reports which confirm the beneficial clinical effects of splenectomy on integrity of the residual liver following liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients with hypersplenism and portal hypertension. This experimental study was designed on hamsters to evaluate the proliferative capacity and function of the remaining liver lobes; in which splenectomy was done simultaneously with partial hepatectomy compared with those in which splenectomy was not done. Forty hamsters were divided into two groups: GI; in which partial hepatectomy was performed without splenectomy and the GII; in which animals were subjected to partial hepatectomy with prior splenectomy. Animals from each group were subjected to liver biopsy from the remaining lobes 48, 72 hours and one week after surgery. Also, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin were tested before, 48, 72 hours and one week after hepatectomy. Hepatic regeneration in the remaining lobes was assessed through histo-pathological study, DNA ploidy of the hepatic nuclei using computerized image analysis system and determining of the labeling index of the nuclear factor NF Kappa B (P105), a novel monoclonal antibody specific for P105 protein by immunohistochemistry. In GII: induction of NK kappa B (P105) labeling index showed maximum expression depending on the regenerative capacity of the remaining liver lobes. In contrast, in GI; liver regeneration was slow. Also, changes in liver function of GII indicated that splenectomy prior hepatecotomy may minimize dysfunction in the remaining hypertrophied liver lobes." ;

      dc:description "BACKGROUND: Cell surface 6-sulfated glycans play important roles in various immunological events through cell-to-cell interactions. The 6-sulfation process is mediated by 6-sulfotransferase family isoenzymes. We previously demonstrated that GlcNAc6ST-1, one of the isoenzyme genes, is induced by GATA-3 and NF-κB in human helper T (Th) cells. However, transcriptional regulation of HEC-GlcNAc6ST, another isoenzyme important in Th cells, remains unclear. METHODS: 5'-RACE analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and reporter assays were performed to reveal transcriptional regulation of HEC-GlcNAc6ST. RNA-knockdown and forced expression experiments were performed to demonstrate the contribution of HEC-GlcNAc6ST to the 6-sulfated glycan expression. RESULTS: We identified potential binding sites of Sp1, T-bet, and GATA-3 in the HEC-GlcNAc6ST promoter. Reporter assays indicated that transfection of Sp1 enhanced the activity, whereas mithramycin A, an Sp1-specific inhibitor, repressed it. Transfection of T-bet increased the activity, which was inhibited by introducing a mutation into the potential T-bet binding site. GATA-3 alone could not elevate the activity, although co-transfection of protein kinase A, which is known to enhance IL-5 transcription in Th2 cells through phosphorylation of GATA-3, caused elevation. RNA-knockdown and forced expression of HEC-GlcNAc6ST in Jurkat cells down- and up-regulated α2,6-sialylated 6-sulfo N-acetyllactosamine, a preferential ligand for B-cell-specific CD22 antigen, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: T-bet and GATA-3, master transcription factors of Th1-Th2 differentiation, as well as Sp1 control the expression of glycan with cell-adhesion activity by regulating HEC-GlcNAc6ST transcription in Th cells. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: These results may provide a clue to biological regulation of Th-cell interaction with selectins and other carbohydrate-recognition molecules by T-bet and GATA-3." ;

      rdfs:comment """Our lab has obtained data on the role of IL-10 and IDO in relation to Th1 and inflammatory responses in a colitis model tested on mice. IDO appears critical for the regulation of TNBS colitis upon CTLA-4 engagement, as the beneficial effect of anti-CTLA-4 treatment was lost in IDO-deficient mice. By contrast, the absence of IDO did not alter the course of inflammation in mice injected with TNBS only, an unexpected finding which suggests that IDO-dependent counter-regulation requires other factors/cells in addition to IDO production and T cell activation by TNBS. Our observations would suggest a critical role for activated Treg, producing IL-10 and expressing high levels of CTLA-4, ICOS and FoxP3. 

We have investigated the respective role of IL-10 and IDO, both required for Th1 suppression in this model. As IL-10 has been shown to indirectly dampen Th1 responses through the inhibition of IL-12 production by antigen-presenting-cells, we monitored mRNA expression specific for the inducible chain IL-12 p35 in lymph nodes draining the site of injection or in mesenteric lymph nodes of mice instilled intra-colonically with TNBS. Our results clearly show that IL-12 production early after the onset of the response was unaffected by anti-CTLA-4 treatment.  By contrast, our data confirm previous data showing that IL-10 is critical for IDO production by DC in vitro, suggesting that IL-10 may act upstream by modulating the expression of IDO. As IDO expression was detected in the colon but not in the spleen or mesenteric lymph nodes, we postulate that IDO may act as anti-inflammatory agent in the intestine and that IL-10 may inhibit Th1 activation in the lymphoid organs and enhance IDO expression in the gut.

We will complete these experiments by (1) testing whether IL-10 is required for IDO expression in vivo; (2) evaluating the role of ICOShi regulatory T cells in the intestine in steady state conditions and (3) the role of intestinal flora in the development of these cells using axenic mice. In parallel, we are testing whether the population of natural regulatory T cells (CD25+) control immune responses by acting on antigen-presenting-cells and in particular on dendritic cells.""" ;

We here examined the effect of FTY720 and a selective S1P receptor type 1 agonist CYM5442 on atherosclerosis in moderately hypercholesterolemic LDL-R(-/-) mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: LDL-R(-/-) mice fed Western diet (0.25% cholesterol) were given FTY720 (0.4mg/kg/day) or CYM5442 (2.0mg/kg/day) for 18weeks. FTY720 but not CYM5422 persistently lowered blood lymphocytes, depleted CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in spleen and lymph nodes, and reduced splenocyte IL-2 secretion. However, both compounds reduced the activity of splenic and peritoneal macrophages as inferred from the down-regulated CD68 and MHC-II expression in CD11b(+) cells and the reduced IL-6 secretion in response to LPS, respectively. CYM5442 and FTY720 reduced weight gain, white adipose tissue depots and fasting glucose suggesting improvement of metabolic control, but failed to influence atherosclerosis in LDL-R(-/-) mice. CONCLUSION: Despite down-regulating macrophage function and - in case of FTY720 - altering lymphocyte distribution CYM5442 and FTY720 fail to affect atherosclerosis in moderately hypercholesterolemic LDL-R(-/-) mice. We hypothesize that S1P mimetics exert atheroprotective effects only under conditions of increased cholesterol burden exacerbating vascular inflammation." ;

      rdfs:comment """We have data available on the role of chemokine receptors in regulating migration of mature DC and subsets of effector and memory T cells in secondary lymphoid organs. CCR7 is a chemokine receptor that is expressed by mature DCs and central memory T cells (TCM) and regulate migration of these cells in secondary lymphoid organs in the steady state.  T lymphocytes lacking the lymph node homing receptors L-selectin and CCR7 do not migrate to lymph nodes in the steady state. In contrast it was found that lymph nodes that drain sites of mature DC or adjuvant inoculation recruited L-selectin- CCR7- effector and memory CD8+ T cells. This cell recruitment required CXCR3 expression on T cells and occurred through high endothelial cells (HEV) in concert with HEV luminal expression of the CXCR3 ligand CXCL9. In reactive lymph nodes, recruited T cells established stable interactions with and killed antigen-bearing DC, limiting the ability of these DCs to activate naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The inducible recruitment of blood-borne effector and memory T cells to lymph nodes may represent a mechanism for terminating primary and limiting secondary immune responses. In addition to CD8+ TEM, CD4+ TEM also migrated in a CD62P-dependent fashion into reactive lymph nodes that were induced to stably express CD62P on high endothelial venules. CD4+ TEM, but not naïve or TCM cells, constitutively expressed CD40L at levels sufficient to induce DC maturation in vitro and in vivo in the absence of antigenic stimulation. Presentation of a MOG peptide by TEM-licensed DC was sufficient to induce experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Importantly, DC maturation and autoimmunity were inhibited by antibodies to CD62P that prevented CD4+ TEM migration into lymph nodes. These results provide a mechanistic link between lymphocyte traffic in lymph nodes and induction of autoimmune diseases.

We are currently investigating how CDP to cDC and pDC development is guided by external stimuli in vitro and in vivo. To this end, we evaluate the differentiation pathways upon inflammatory stimuli as TLR agonists. Furthermore, we have generated cytokine deficient animals (GM-CSF-/-Flt3L-/-) with the intention to test the combined effects of these cytokines on DC development in vivo. Also, we are in collaboration with Dr. Tim Sparwasser's laboratory at the TU Munich currently generating Flt3 and Flt3L reporter mice with the intention to elucidate in vivo DC developmental regions in steady state and inflammation in situ.""" ;

      dc:description "Cancer immunotherapy requires potent tumor-specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cell responses, initiated by dendritic cells (DCs). Tumor antigens can be specifically targeted to DCs in vivo by exploiting their expression of C-type lectin receptors (CLR), which bind carbohydrate structures on antigens, resulting in internalization and antigen presentation to T-cells. We explored the potential of glycan-modified liposomes to target antigens to DCs to boost murine and human T-cell responses. Since DC-SIGN is a CLR expressed on DCs, liposomes were modified with DC-SIGN-binding glycans Lewis (Le)(B) or Le(X). Glycan modification of liposomes resulted in increased binding and internalization by BMDCs expressing human DC-SIGN. In the presence of LPS, this led to 100-fold more efficient presentation of the encapsulated antigens to CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells compared to unmodified liposomes or soluble antigen. Similarly, incubation of human moDC with melanoma antigen MART-1-encapsulated liposomes coated with Le(X) in the presence of LPS led to enhanced antigen-presentation to MART-1-specific CD8(+) T-cell clones. Moreover, this formulation drove primary CD8(+) T-cells to differentiate into high numbers of tetramer-specific, IFN-γ-producing effector T-cells. Together, our data demonstrate the potency of a glycoliposome-based vaccine targeting DC-SIGN for CD4(+) and CD8(+) effector T-cell activation. This approach may offer improved options for treatment of cancer patients and opens the way to in situ DC-targeted vaccination." ;

Although multiple mechanisms of Treg action have been proposed, the actual mechanism involved in the suppression of anti tumor T cell responses are still unclear. 
Treg inactivation by anti-CD25 antibodies or by depletion in FoxP3-DTR DEREG mice resulted in effective rejection of the tumors upon adoptive transfer of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Treg inactivation or depletion induces a marked arrest in the migration of anti-tumor CD8+ T cells selectively in tumor-draining lymph nodes. Reduced T cell motility in lymph nodes was associated with an amplification of the effector cells, increased IFN? production, and tumor rejection. 
We also show that Tregs make multiple brief contacts with the CD8+ T cells in the lymph nodes of tumor bearing mice. The frequency of these interactions, but not their duration, was inhibited by the treatment with anti-CD25 antibodies. We conclude that direct contacts between CD8+ T cells and Tregs in tumor-draining lymph nodes may contribute to the inhibition of anti-tumor immune responses. However, we were unable to establish the functional relevance of the direct Treg-CD8+ T cell contacts that we imaged.
Besides, Treg inactivation also induces an increase in the number of dendritic cells (DCs) in these tumor-draining lymph nodes. Therefore Tregs could influence CD8+ T cell arrest by modulating the number of antigen presenting cells in the tumor-draining lymph nodes.

DCs have developed numerous specializations to adapt their internalization pathway to efficient antigen processing. Recruitment of ER components to phagosomes has been postulated as one of the high specializations required to allow exogenous antigens to reach MHC class I pathway. However, no direct evidence of a fusion between those compartments has been reported. We will use a lentiviral-based approach to knock down protein expression of molecules potentially involved in ER-phagosome and we will test how this affect cross presentation in BMDCs.
Also, we are planning to investigate the mechanisms by which Tregs limit DC accumulation in tumor-draining lymph nodes. Preliminary results suggest that Treg may reduce DC survival in tumor draining lymph nodes. Therefore, we will use two photon microscopy to analyse DC survival in vivo and unravel the molecular mechanisms involved.""" ;

      dc:description "A variety of functionally important protein properties, such as secondary structure, transmembrane topology and solvent accessibility, can be encoded as a labeling of amino acids. Indeed, the prediction of such properties from the primary amino acid sequence is one of the core projects of computational biology. Accordingly, a panoply of approaches have been developed for predicting such properties; however, most such approaches focus on solving a single task at a time. Motivated by recent, successful work in natural language processing, we propose to use multitask learning to train a single, joint model that exploits the dependencies among these various labeling tasks. We describe a deep neural network architecture that, given a protein sequence, outputs a host of predicted local properties, including secondary structure, solvent accessibility, transmembrane topology, signal peptides and DNA-binding residues. The network is trained jointly on all these tasks in a supervised fashion, augmented with a novel form of semi-supervised learning in which the model is trained to distinguish between local patterns from natural and synthetic protein sequences. The task-independent architecture of the network obviates the need for task-specific feature engineering.

      dc:description "One alternative for management of brucellosis in Yellowstone National Park bison (Bison bison) is vaccination of calves and yearlings. Although RB51 vaccination protects bison against experimental challenge, the effect of booster vaccination was unknown. This study characterized immunologic responses after dart or booster vaccination of bison with Brucella abortus strains RB51 (RB51). In two studies, 8 to 10 month old, female bison were inoculated with saline (n=14), hand vaccinated with 1.1-2.0 × 10(10) CFU of RB51 (n=21) or dart vaccinated with 1.8 × 10(10) CFU of RB51 (n=7). A subgroup of hand vaccinates in study 1 were randomly selected for booster vaccination 15 months later with 2.2 × 10(10) CFU of RB51. When compared to single vaccinates, booster vaccinated bison had greater serologic responses to RB51 However, there was a trend for antigen-specific proliferative responses of PBMC from booster vaccinates to be reduced when compared to responses of PBMC from single vaccinates. PBMC from booster vaccinates tended to have greater interferon-γ production when compared to single vaccinates. In general, dart vaccination with RB51 induced similar immunologic responses as compared to hand vaccination. All vaccinates (single hand, dart, or booster) demonstrated greater (P<0.05) immunologic responses at various times after vaccination when compared to non-vaccinated bison. Booster vaccination with RB51 in early gestation did not induce abortion or fetal infection. Our data suggests that booster vaccination does not induce strong anamnestic responses. However, phenotypic data on resistance to experimental challenge will be required to fully assess the effect of booster vaccination on protective immunity." ;

RIG-I is generally thought to be activated by ssRNA species containing a 5'-triphosphate (PPP) group or by unphosphorylated dsRNA up to ∼300 bp in length. However, it is not yet clear how changes in the length, nucleotide sequence, secondary structure, and 5' end modification affect the abilities of these ligands to bind and activate RIG-I. To further investigate these parameters in the context of naturally occurring ligands, we examined RNA sequences derived from the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTR) of the influenza virus NS1 gene segment. As expected, RIG-I-dependent interferon-β (IFN-β) induction by sequences from the 5' UTR of the influenza cRNA or its complement (26 nt in length) required the presence of a 5'PPP group. In contrast, activation of RIG-I by the 3' UTR cRNA sequence or its complement (172 nt) exhibited only a partial 5'PPP-dependence, as capping the 5' end or treatment with CIP showed a modest reduction in RIG-I activation. Furthermore, induction of IFN-β by a smaller, U/A-rich region within the 3' UTR was completely 5'PPP-independent. Our findings demonstrated that RNA sequence, length, and secondary structure all contributed to whether or not the 5'PPP moiety is needed for interferon induction by RIG-I." ;

      dc:description "OBJECTIVE: To determine if the complete response rates of lentigo maligna (LM) to imiquimod, 5%, cream can be improved by the addition of a topical retinoid. DESIGN: Prospective randomized study of patients treated with imiquimod alone vs imiquimod plus a topical retinoid, followed by conservative staged excisions. SETTING: Mohs surgical clinic in an academic institution. Patients  Ninety patients with biopsy-confirmed LM. Interventions  Ninety patients with 91 LMs were randomized into 2 groups. One group received imiquimod, 5%, cream 5 d/wk for 3 months, while the other group also received tazarotene, 0.1%, gel 2 d/wk for 3 months. Following topical therapy, all patients underwent staged excisions and frozen section analysis with Melan-A immunostaining to confirm negative margins. Main Outcome Measure  The presence or absence of residual LM at the time of staged excision. RESULTS: Forty-six patients with 47 LMs were randomized to receive monotherapy: 42 of 47 LMs reached the intended treatment duration, with 27 complete responses (64%). Forty-four patients with 44 LMs were randomized to receive combined therapy: 37 of 44 LMs reached the intended treatment duration, with 29 complete responses (78%). This difference did not reach statistical significance (P = .17). There have been no recurrences to date, with a mean follow-up period of 42 months. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who received topical imiquimod with vs without tazarotene, 22% (8 of 37) of lesions vs 36% (15 of 42) of lesions showed residual LM on staged excisions. Pretreating LM with imiquimod, 5%, cream may decrease surgical defect sizes; however, total reliance on topical imiquimod as an alternative to surgery may put the patient at increased risk of a local recurrence.

We set an in vitro system able to detect fona fide in vivo primed CD4+ T cells. Purified CD4+ T cells are first stimulated in vitro once in the presence peptides, previously identified as containing naturally processed epitopes on tumour-associated antigens. After two weeks, proliferation and cytokine secretion (IFN-?, IL-5, IL-4, IL-2, TNF-?, IL-10, TGF-?, IL-17, granzyme and perforin) are tested. To estimate the frequency of antigen specific CD4+ T cell we used intracellular staining for IFN-? and/or IL-13, following indications from restimulation assays. We investigated the spontaneous CD4+ T cell immunity to MAGE-A3 and CEA in normal donors and in patients with advanced melanoma and pancreas carcinoma, respectively. We found that MAGE-A3 specific CD4+ T cells, which showed an unpolarized or Th2 skewed phenotype, were present in the blood of a high percentage of melanoma patients. We also found that pancreatic cancer patients compared to normal donors have impaired quantitative (i.e., reduced number of responders) and qualitative (i.e., Th2 skew) anti-CEA CD4+ T cell response. Importantly, anti-viral CD4+ T immunity was preserved. These results suggest that local more than systemic immunoregulatory mechanisms are active in pancreatic cancer. We have optimized the MAGE-A3 peptides to load onto HLA-DR*1101 tetramers by generating minimal peptide analogues containing a single anchor residue and we succeeded to produce functional HLA-DR*1101 tetramers.

We plan to continue the monitoring of vaccine and tumour specific T cell responses in vaccinated melanoma patients and the spontaneous anti-tumour CD4+ T cell immunity in patients with MAGE-A3, CEA and HPV expressing neoplastic lesions by the use of the strategies developed inclusive of the HLA-DR*1101 tetramers.""" ;

These DC co-localize with B cells and these clusters are occupying architecturally definable niches and are reminiscent to the niches that were found in the cranial BM parenchyma. By using Fibronectin antibody the stroma of the BM could be visualized. In addition, a large fraction of IgA positive plasma cells is located in the BM. Staining for these cells revealed that plasma cells are scattered through the BM and are not preferentially found in DC-B cell niche.

      dc:description "Integrins are a family of heterodimeric glycoproteins on cell surfaces that mediate diverse biological events involving cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions (1). Integrins consist of an α and a β subunit and are important for cell adhesion and signal transduction. The αvβ3 integrin is the most prominent receptor affecting tumor growth, tumor invasiveness, metastasis, tumor-induced angiogenesis, inflammation, osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (2-7). Expression of the αvβ3 integrin is strong on tumor cells and activated endothelial cells, whereas expression is weak on resting endothelial cells and most normal tissues. The αvβ3 antagonists are being studied as antitumor and antiangiogenic agents and the agonists are being studied as angiogenic agents for coronary angiogenesis (6, 8, 9). The peptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) has been identified as a recognition motif used by extracellular matrix proteins (vitronectin, fibrinogen, laminin, and collagen) to bind to a variety of integrins, including αvβ3. Various radiolabeled antagonists have been introduced for imaging of tumors and tumor angiogenesis (10). Most of the cyclic RGD peptides are composed of five amino acids. Various cyclic RGD peptides exhibit selective inhibition of binding to αvβ3 (50% inhibition concentration (IC50), 7–40 nM) but not to αvβ5 (IC50, 600–4,000 nM) or αIIbβ3 (IC50, 700–5,000 nM) integrins (11). Various radiolabeled cyclic RGD peptides and peptidomimetics have been found to have high accumulation in tumors in mice (12, 13). From these developments, [18F]galacto-c(RGDfK) has been evaluated in a number of clinical studies for imaging of αvβ3 in cancer patients (14-18). Knetsch et al. (19) reported the development of 68Ga-1,4,7-triazacyclononane,1-glutaric acid-4,7-acetic acid-cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Lys) (68Ga-NODAGA-c(RGDfK)) for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of αvβ3 receptors in nude mice bearing melanoma tumors. 1-(1-Carboxy-3-carbo-tert-butoxypropyl)-4,7-(carbo-tert-butoxymethyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane (NODAGA(tBu)3) was used to prepare 68Ga-NODAGA-c(RGDfK). Dumont et al. (20) chelated NODAGA-c(RGDfK) with 64Cu to form 64Cu-NODAGA-c(RGDfK) for PET imaging of αvβ3 receptors in nude mice bearing human glioblastoma tumors." ;

      dc:description "We have recently shown that reverse transcriptases (RTs) can perform template switches with very short (two nucleotides) complementarities between the 3'-ends of the primer (donor) strand and the DNA or RNA template acceptor strands [Oz-Gleenberg et. al., Nucleic Acids Research, 39, 1042-1053, 2011]. These dinucleotide pairs are stabilized by RTs that are capable of \"clamping\" together the otherwise unstable duplexes. Consequently, this RT-driven stabilization of the micro-homology sequence promotes efficient DNA synthesis. In the present study, we have examined several factors associated with sequence and structure of the DNA substrate, which are critical for the clamp activity of various RTs, namely, those of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), murine leukemia virus (MLV), bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) and of the LTR retrotransposon Tf1. The studied parameters were: the minimal complementarity length between the primer and functional template termini that can still sustain stable clamps; the effects of gaps between the two template strands on the clamp activity of the tested RTs; the effects of template end phosphorylations on the RT-associated clamp activities; the clamp activity with a long \"hairpin\" double-stranded primer, composed of both the primer and the complementary non-functional template strands. The results show that the substrates for the clamp activity of HIV-1 and MLV RTs are more stringent, while Tf1 and BIV RTs can clamp under less rigorous substrate conditions. These differences can shed light on interesting dissimilarities in the catalytic activities of RTs and may define the clamp activity as a potential new target for anti-retroviral drugs." ;

      rdfs:comment """Our lab has obtained data on indirect activation of DC by immunomodulatory mediators.

TLRs signal directly for DC activation but also promote production of immunomodulatory mediators by many other cell types. These mediators could be sufficient to activate DC indirectly, thereby potentially allowing responses to organisms with which DC do not come into direct contact. 

We tested this hypothesis and, surprisingly, found that indirect signals alone led only to partial DC activation and resulted in clonal expansion of T cells lacking typical Th1 or Th2 function. These results show that indirect signals by themselves cannot fully substitute for TLR triggering in DC and further suggest that the function of TLRs and other pattern recognition receptors expressed by APC is to regulate production of Th-directing cytokines, allowing APC to couple the class of adaptive immune response to the nature of the pathogen. This has important implication for the design of cancer vaccines and is of direct relevance to the goals of the network.""" ;

      dc:description "Human amniotic membrane-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAM-MSCs) are capable of differentiating into several lineages and possess immunomodulatory properties. In this study, we investigated the soluble factor-mediated immunomodulatory effects of hAM-MSCs. Mitogen-induced peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation was suppressed by hAM-MSCs in a dose-dependent manner as well as hAM-MSC culture supernatant. Moreover, interferon-gamma and interleukin (IL)-17 production significantly decreased from PBMC, whereas IL-10 from PBMCs and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) production from hAM-MSCs significantly increased in co-cultures of hAM-MSCs and PBMCs. Production of several MSC factors, including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), TGF-β, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase (IDO), increased significantly in hAM-MSCs co-cultured with PBMCs. These results indicate that the immunomodulatory effects of hAM-MSCs may be associated with soluble factors (TGF-β, HGF, PGE2, and IDO), suggesting that hAM-MSCs may have potential clinical use in regenerative medicine." ;

We found that CyP acts as a potent and selective antagonist of bacterial LPS. CyP did not induce any detectable response in human DCs and competitively inhibited LPS binding to the extracellular domain of TLR4. Addition of CyP together with LPS completely inhibited both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways and suppressed the whole LPS-induced gene transcription program. CyP was effective in protecting mice from endotoxin shock in spite of a lower capacity to inhibit LPS stimulation of mouse DCs.  Remarkably, delayed addition of CyP to DCs responding to LPS strongly inhibited signaling and cytokine production by immediate down-regulation of inflammatory cytokine mRNAs, while not affecting other aspects of DC maturation such as expression of MHC, costimulatory molecules and CCR7. These results open promising perspectives for the use of CyP as a therapeutic agent able to modulate innate and adaptive immune responses and reveal the requirement of sustained TLR4 stimulation for induction of cytokine gene expression in human DCs." ;

In this study we report the analysis of the CTL response of a second melanoma patient who showed a mixed tumor response after vaccination with dendritic cells pulsed with two MAGE-A3 antigenic peptides presented, respectively, by HLA-A1 and HLA-DP4. Anti-MAGE-3.A1 CD8 and anti-MAGE-3.DP4 CD4 T cells became detectable in the blood after vaccination at a frequency of approximately 10(-5) among the CD8 or CD4 T cells, respectively, and they were slightly enriched in slowly progressing metastases. Additional anti-tumor CTL were present in the blood at a frequency of 2x10(-4) among the CD8 T cells and, among these, an anti-MAGE-C2 CTL clone was detected only following vaccination and was enriched by >1,000-fold in metastases relative to the blood. The striking similarity of these results with our previous observations further supports the hypothesis that the induction of a few anti-vaccine T cells may prime or restimulate additional anti-tumor T cell clones that are mainly responsible for the tumor regression." ;

      dc:description "Over the past two decades, gene therapy has garnered tremendous attention and is heralded by many as the ultimate cure to treat diseases such as cancer, viral infections, and inherited genetic disorders. However, the therapeutic applications of nucleic acids extend beyond the delivery of double-stranded DNA and subsequent expression of deficient gene products in diseased tissue. Other strategies include antisense oligonucleotides and most notably RNA interference (RNAi). Antisense strategies bear great potential for the treatment of diseases that are caused by misspliced mRNA, and RNAi is a universal and extraordinarily efficient tool to knock down the expression of virtually any gene by specific degradation of the desired target mRNA. However, because of the hurdles associated with effective delivery of nucleic acids across a cell membrane, the initial euphoria surrounding siRNA therapy soon subsided. The ability of oligonucleotides to cross the plasma membrane is hampered by their size and highly negative charge. Viral vectors have long been the gold standard to overcome this barrier, but they are associated with severe immunogenic effects and possible tumorigenesis. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), cationic peptides that can translocate through the cell membrane independent of receptors and can transport cargo including proteins, small organic molecules, nanoparticles, and oligonucleotides, represent a promising class of nonviral delivery vectors. This Account focuses on peptide carrier systems for the cellular delivery of various types of therapeutic nucleic acids with a special emphasis on cell-penetrating peptides. We also emphasize the clinical relevance of this research through examples of promising in vivo studies. Although CPPs are often derived from naturally occurring protein transduction domains, they can also be artificially designed. Because CPPs typically include many positively charged amino acids, those electrostatic interactions facilitate the formation of complexes between the carriers and the oligonucleotides. One drawback of CPP-mediated delivery includes entrapment of the cargo in endosomes because uptake tends to be endocytic: coupling of fatty acids or endosome-disruptive peptides to the CPPs can overcome this problem. CPPs can also lack specificity for a single cell type, which can be addressed through the use of targeting moieties, such as peptide ligands that bind to specific receptors. Researchers have also applied these strategies to cationic carrier systems for nonviral oligonucleotide delivery, such as liposomes or polymers, but CPPs tend to be less cytotoxic than other delivery vehicles." ;

      dc:description "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that trigger innate immune response and mediate acquired immunity. Evidence has shown that SARM1 (sterile-α and TIR motif containing protein 1) is one of five TIR domain-containing adaptor proteins involved in TLRs signaling transduction. In the present study, a full-length cDNA sequence was cloned for the porcine SARM1 gene, which contains nine exons. Using the radiation hybrid mapping approach, we assigned the porcine gene to SSC12 q13. Under the normal condition, porcine SARM1 was highly expressed in brain and spleen. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly (I:C)) weakly induced the porcine SARM1 expression in the early stimulation. We found that porcine SARM1 protein is localized in mitochondria and attenuates NF-κB activation induced by stimulation and infection. The quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) analysis showed that the expression of porcine SARM1 significantly decreased in several tissues of Tongcheng pigs infected with highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV). Gene-interaction network analysis for porcine SARM1 in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) showed that down-regulation of SARM1 gene in infected Tongcheng pig may modulate TRIF-depend TLRs signaling and regulate the expression of disease-resistant genes and inflammatory genes. Our findings provide evidence that porcine SARM1 may play an important role in immune regulation with PRRSV infection." ;

Data has been obtained on the  cellular organization of the marrow of long bones.

The bone marrow (BM) is a primary lymphoid organ, where diverse hematopoietic lineages arise from common multi-potential progenitors [1]. However, aside from this established role in hematopoiesis, the BM also serves as secondary lymphoid organ in the generation of adaptive T and B cell immune responses [2,3]. It has been shown that the BM is also populated by mature lymphocytes, which home to the BM and seem to inhabit specific niches [2,4]. Two photon microscopic analysis of mouse skull BM revealed that the BM-resident Dendritic cells (bmDC) in the cranial BM parenchyma are organized in unique peri-vascular clusters tightly wrapped around distinct BM blood vessels and occupying architecturally definable niches. Interestingly, these clusters are reminiscent of recently reported peri-sinusoidal niches that are defined by mature re-circulating B cells [2]. We showed that grafted B and T cells efficiently homed to the BM and their distribution was restricted to the extra-vascular areas covered by bmDC. Using a conditional in vivo DC ablation system, we analyzed the BM and periphery of DC-depleted mice and found that bmDC ablation led to a profound B cell reduction. The effect was specific to the BM, since the frequencies of B cells in the spleen and lymph nodes were not impaired. Moreover, the reduction was specific for recirculating mature B cell compartment, whereas B cell development was unaffected by bmDC ablation. This phenotype could be reverted by B cell over-expression of the anti-apoptotic factor bcl2. Moreover, we showed that re-circulating B cell survival requires the presence of bmDC, which produce macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in the perivascular BM niches [5]. 

The aim of my visit at the Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ) and the laboratory of Prof. Andreas Radbruch was to study the organization of bmDC, B lymphocytes and plasma cells in the BM of the long bones by immunochistochemistry. During my visit I learned the preparation of the bones for histology, crysectioning, immunohistochemistry and analysis of the stained sections by confocal microscope.
Using a CX3CR1GFP mice, in which bmDC are green fluorescent (GFP), I analyzed the bmDC localization and found the the cells organized in unique clusters, mainly located in the endosteum of the BM. These DC co-localize with B cells and these clusters are occupying architecturally definable niches and are reminiscent to the niches that were found in the cranial BM parenchyma. By using Fibronectin antibody I could visualize the stroma of the BM. In addition, a large fraction of IgA positive plasma cells is located in the BM. Staining for these cells revealed that plasma cells are scattered through the BM and are not preferentially found in DC-B cell niche. However, depletion of DC led to reduction in IgA+ plasma cells, which might indicate that bmDC are critical for survival of these cells in the BM. Thus, additional experiments will be conducted in order to understand the interactions between bmDC and plasma cells.

      rdfs:comment """We have obtained data from a study where we addressed a model antigen to exosomes secreted by tumor cells in vivo, to allow capture of antigen-bearing exosomes by DCs and cross-presentation of the antigen. For this purpose, the model antigen OVA was fused to the C1C2 exosome-binding domain of MFG-E8/lactadherin. Tumors secreting the exosome-bound antigen grow slower than tumors secreting soluble OVA, because they induce activation of OVA-specific CD8+ T cells into killer cells. In addition, inducing in vivo secretion of the C1C2-coupled antigen by DNA vaccination induces prevention against subsequent tumor growth. These results show for the first time a function for exosome secretion in vivo. A paper describing these results has been published in 2008 (Zeelenberg et al., Cancer Research).
Our goal is now to develop the C1C2-based DNA vaccination approach to obtain an efficient anti-tumor therapeutic vaccine in mouse models. In parallel, we are analysing the mechanisms of exosome secretion in vitro. The goal of this project is to identify tools to inhibit or increase exosome secretion in vivo, and thus decipher their physiological roles, as well as modulate exosome-dependent immune responses.""" ;

      dc:description "Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is considered to be the most effective immunostimulating factor for the construction of gene-engineered anti-cancer vaccines. In some tumour cells, this type of genetic modification has resulted in the loss of the oncogenic potential. This was not the case with bcr-abl-transformed mouse 12B1 cells. A cell line, designated 12B1/GM-CSF/cl-5 producing more than 100 ng/106 cells/24 h, displayed higher pathogenicity than the parental, non-transduced cells. Although the tumours induced by the parental 12B1 cells and 12B1/GM-CSF/cl-5 cells appeared nearly at the same time and then grew at an approximately equal rate, the latter mice were in a much poorer clinical condition. In these animals the growth of the tumours was associated with gradually increasing blood levels of GM-CSF. In both groups of animals splenomegaly was observed; it was much more pronounced in the case of 12B1/GM-CSF/cl-5-inoculated animals. While in the case of animals inoculated with the parental cells the splenomegaly was probably mainly due to infiltration with tumour cells, in the animals inoculated with the GM-CSF-secreting cells splenomegaly and derangement of parenchymal organs, such as lungs, liver and kidneys, were more complex, including congestion and infiltration with hemopoietic cells, predominantly immature cells of myeloid lineage. The most conspicuous of these changes was the hyperaemia of the lungs. No such alterations were seen in animals inoculated with the parental cells. On the other hand, the contents of T regulatory cells were comparable in both groups and they increased in parallel at the end of the observation period. When GM-CSF neutralizing antibody was administered to animals inoculated with the 12B1/GM-CSF/cl-5 cells, the pathological changes observed within the organs were suppressed, this proving that the overproduced GM-CSF and not any other substance, played the key role in their induction." ;

      dc:description "The death receptor Fas and its physiological ligand (FasL) regulate apoptosis of cancerous cells, thereby functioning as a critical component of the host cancer immunosurveillance system. To evade Fas-mediated apoptosis, cancer cells often downregulate Fas to acquire an apoptosis-resistant phenotype, which is a hallmark of metastatic human colorectal cancer. Therefore, targeting Fas resistance is of critical importance in Fas-based cancer therapy and immunotherapy. In this study, we demonstrated that epigenetic inhibitors decitabine and vorinostat cooperate to upregulate Fas expression in metastatic human colon carcinoma cells. Decitabine also upregulates BNIP3 and Bik expression, whereas vorinostat decreased Bcl-x(L) expression. Altered expression of Fas, BNIP3, Bik, and Bcl-x(L) resulted in effective sensitization of the metastatic human colon carcinoma cells to FasL-induced apoptosis. Using an experimental metastasis mouse model, we further demonstrated that decitabine and vorinostat cooperate to suppress colon carcinoma metastasis. Analysis of tumor-bearing lung tissues revealed that a large portion of tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells are FasL(+), and decitabine and vorinostat-mediated tumor-suppression efficacy was significantly decreased in Fas(gld) mice compared with wild-type mice, suggesting a critical role for FasL in decitabine and vorinostat-mediated tumor suppression in vivo. Consistent with their function in apoptosis sensitization, decitabine and vorinostat significantly increased the efficacy of CTL adoptive transfer immunotherapy in an experimental metastasis mouse model. Thus, our data suggest that combined modalities of chemotherapy to sensitize the tumor cell to Fas-mediated apoptosis and CTL immunotherapy is an effective approach for the suppression of colon cancer metastasis." ;

      dc:description "Biochemical strategies that use a combination of synthetic oligonucleotides, thermostable DNA polymerases, and DNA ligases can produce large DNA constructs up to 1 megabase in length. Although these ambitious targets are feasible biochemically, comparable technologies for the chemical synthesis of long DNA strands lag far behind. The best available chemical approach is the solid-phase phosphoramidite method, which can be used to assemble DNA strands up to 150 bases in length. Beyond this point, deficiencies in the chemistry make it impossible to produce pure DNA. A possible alternative approach to the chemical synthesis of large DNA strands is to join together carefully purified synthetic oligonucleotides by chemical methods. Click ligation by the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne (CuAAC) reaction could facilitate this process. In this Account, we describe the synthesis, characterization, and applications of oligonucleotides prepared by click ligation. The alkyne and azide oligonucleotide strands can be prepared by standard protocols, and the ligation reaction is compatible with a wide range of chemical modifications to DNA and RNA. We have employed click ligation to synthesize DNA constructs up to 300 bases in length and much longer sequences are feasible. When the resulting triazole linkage is placed in a PCR template, various DNA polymerases correctly copy the entire base sequence. We have also successfully demonstrated both in vitro transcription and rolling circle amplification through the modified linkage. This linkage has shown in vivo biocompatibility: an antibiotic resistance gene containing triazole linkages functions in E. coli . Using click ligation, we have synthesized hairpin ribozymes up to 100 nucleotides in length and a hammerhead ribozyme with the triazole linkage located at the substrate cleavage site. At the opposite end of the length scale, click-ligated, cyclic mini-DNA duplexes have been used as models to study base pairing. Cyclic duplexes have potential therapeutic applications. They have extremely high thermodynamic stability, have increased resistance to enzymatic degradation, and have been investigated as decoys for regulatory proteins. For potential nanotechnology applications, we have synthesized double stranded DNA catenanes by click ligation. Other researchers have studied covalently fixed multistranded DNA constructs including triplexes and quadruplexes." ;

Arsenic, an environmental contaminant distributed worldwide, affects the immune system. This study tested the hypothesis that arsenic has distinct effects on T cell proliferation and the production of cytokines by activated T cells. Murine splenocytes from young (2 months) and aged (24-26 months) C57BL/6 mice were exposed to arsenite (As(3+)), the most toxic form of inorganic arsenic, and stimulated with concanavalin A (Con A) or anti-CD3 antibody. T cell proliferation decreased significantly in response to Con A and anti-CD3 at subtoxic doses of arsenite in splenocytes from both young and aged mice. Arsenite, added concurrently with Con A or anti-CD3, significantly inhibited the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and interleukin-4 (IL-4) by splenocytes from young mice and significantly reduced the production of IL-10 by splenocytes from aged mice. In contrast, the production of IL-2 and IL-4 by splenocytes from aged mice was only slightly affected by arsenite. The results show that arsenic exposure reduces the immune response in splenocytes. Moreover, this effect may be influenced by aging." ;

      dc:description "T cell memory is the hallmark of adaptive immunity. Central questions are to determine which cells among proliferating effector T cells will live beyond the crash of the immune response (IR) and develop into functional memory T cells. CD47, considered as a marker of self, is implicated in cell death, cell elimination, and in the inflammatory response. We report in this article that CD47 expression was transiently regulated on Ag-specific CD4 T cells, that is, from CD47(high) to CD47(low) to CD47(high), during the course of the in vivo IR. Specifically, CD47(high) status marked central memory CD4 T cell precursors at an early time point of the IR. By contrast, cytokine production was a functional attribute restricted to CD47(high), but not CD47(low), polyclonal effector CD4 T cells during recall responses in an experimental model of chronic airway inflammatory disease. Passive transfer of CD47(high), but not CD47(low), CD4 T cells in nonlymphopenic naive mice generated long-lived memory T cells capable of anamnestic responses. We conclude that CD47(high) status on CD4 T cells identifies functional long-lived memory T cell progenitors." ;

The majority of research space was earmarked for Wellcome Trust-funded research. Recruitment, based on research excellence at all levels in the area of cell biology, began in earnest in 1993, mostly but not exclusively, through the award of Research Fellowships from the Wellcome Trust.

      dc:description "Listeria monocytogenes has been used as an experimental live vector for the induction of CD8-mediated immune responses in various viral and tumoral experimental models. Susceptibility of BALB/c mice to Leishmania major infection has been correlated to the preferential development of Th2 CD4 T cells through an early production of interleukin 4 (IL-4) by a restricted population of CD4 T cells which react to a single parasite antigen, LACK (stands for Leishmania homologue of receptors for activated C kinase). Experimental vaccination with LACK can redirect the differentiation of CD4(+) T cells towards the Th1 pathway if LACK is coadministrated with IL-12. As IL-12 is known to be induced by L. monocytogenes, we have tested the ability of a recombinant attenuated actA mutant L. monocytogenes strain expressing LACK to induce the development of LACK-specific Th1 cells in both B10.D2 and BALB/c mice, which are resistant and susceptible to L. major, respectively. After a single injection of LACK-expressing L. monocytogenes, IL-12/p40 transcripts showed a rapid burst, and peaks of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-secreting LACK-specific Th1 cells were detected around day 5 in the spleens and livers of mice of both strains. These primed IFN-gamma-secreting LACK-reactive T cells were not detected ex vivo after day 7 of immunization but could be recruited and detected 15 days later in the draining lymph node after an L. major footpad challenge. Although immunization of BALB/c mice with LACK-expressing L. monocytogenes did not change the course of the infection with L. major, immunized B10.D2 mice exhibited significantly smaller lesions than nonimmunized controls. Thus, our results demonstrate that, in addition of its recognized use for the induction of effector CD8 T cells, L. monocytogenes can also be used as a live recombinant vector to favor the development of potentially protective IFN-gamma-secreting Th1 CD4 T lymphocytes." ;

The receptor-ligand pair P-selectin and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) are critically involved in this process. In this study, we examined the expression of functional PSGL-1 on bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors. We demonstrate that functional PSGL-1 is expressed at low levels on hematopoietic stem cells, but upregulated on the cell surface of progenitors that bear other homing molecules known to be important for thymic settling. We found that progenitors able to home to the thymus expressed high levels of PSGL-1 transcripts compared with hematopoietic stem cells. We further demonstrate that hematopoietic progenitors lacking fucosyltransferase 4 and 7 do not express functional PSGL-1, and do not home efficiently to the thymus. These studies provide insight into the developmentally regulated expression of a critical determinant involved in progenitor homing to the thymus." ;

Zymolyase (2 mg/ml) was used to digest ascum and liberate spores. Zymoliase was inactivated by heat (65°C for 2 minutes) and washed away carefully together with the remainings of the empty ascus, by resuspending twice the spore culture in 500 µl of distilled water centrifuging and discarding the supernatant; the spores were then resuspended to a concentration of 108 cells/ml. In order to exclude damage on the spore cell wall or effects on spore viability 100 µl of a culture of 1000 spores per ml was plated on YPD in triplicate, the spores showed 100% viability.

      dc:description "Naturally arising CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (nTregs) have an essential role in maintenance of immune homeostasis and peripheral tolerance. Previously, we reported that conventional CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells undergo p53-induced CD28-dependent apoptosis (PICA) when stimulated with a combination of immobilized anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Abs, whereas nTregs expand robustly under the same conditions, suggesting that there is a differential survival mechanism against PICA between conventional T cells and nTregs. In this study, we demonstrate that TGF-β signaling is required for nTregs to survive PICA. Conversely, when an active form of exogenous TGF-β is present, conventional T cells become resistant to PICA and undergo robust expansion instead of apoptosis, with reduction of the proapoptotic protein Bim and FoxO3a. A substantial fraction of PICA-resistant T cells expressed IL-9 (T(H)9 cells). Moreover, the presence of IL-6 along with TGF-β led to the generation of T(H)17 cells from conventional T cells. Together, the data demonstrate a novel role for TGF-β in the homeostasis of regulatory T cells and effector T cell differentiation and expansion." ;

      dc:description "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) increases neurite outgrowth, although signaling via its receptor PACAP-specific receptor (PAC1R) has not been fully characterized. Because mitochondria also play an important role in neurite outgrowth, we examined whether mitochondria contribute to PACAP-mediated neurite outgrowth. When mouse primary hippocampal neurons and Neuro2a cells were exposed to PACAP, neurite outgrowth and the mitochondrial membrane potential increased in both cell types. These results were reproduced using the PAC1R-specific agonist maxadilan and the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, whereas the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 and mitochondrial uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) inhibited these effects. Expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (Pgc1α), a master regulator of mitochondrial activation, and its downstream effectors, such as cytochrome C and cytochrome C oxidase subunit 4, increased in response to PACAP. Knocking down Pgc1α expression using small interfering RNA or treatment with CCCP significantly attenuated neurite outgrowth and reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential in PACAP-treated cells. These data suggest that mitochondrial activation plays a key role in PACAP-induced neurite outgrowth via a signaling pathway that includes PAC1R, PKA, and Pgc1α." ;

This study investigated the linear epitopes recognized by circulating antibodies in anti-GBM patients, aiming to identify the potential nephrogenic linear epitopes and their clinical significance.Design, setting, participants, & measurementsSixty-eight patients with anti-GBM disease were enrolled. Twenty-four overlapping linear peptides were synthesized across the whole sequence of the human Goodpasture autoantigen. ELISA detected circulating antibodies against linear epitopes. Their associations with clinical features were further analyzed.ResultsAntibodies against linear peptides were detected in sera from 55 patients (80.9%). Three major epitopes with high frequencies were identified: P14 (41%), P16 (36.8%), and P18 (57%). P14, a formerly defined T cell epitope, was a mutual B cell epitope. Antibodies against P14 were frequently detected in patients with positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (39.3% versus 12.5%; P=0.01). Patients with anti-P16 antibodies presented with higher serum creatinine on diagnosis (665.5±227.2 versus 443.7±296.8 μmol/L; P=0.001) and worse renal outcome during follow-up (hazard ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-3.90; P=0.02). The level of anti-P18 antibodies positively correlated with the percentage of crescents in glomeruli (r=0.54; P=0.008). Recognition of P22 was an independent predictor for patient death (hazard ratio, 3.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-7.57; P=0.02).ConclusionsAntibodies against linear epitopes on the Goodpasture autoantigen could be detected in human anti-GBM disease and were associated with kidney injury. P14 was a mutual T and B cell epitope, implying its nephrogenic role in disease initiation." ;

      dc:description "The early clinical presentations of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are similar to that of erythema multiforme major (EMM). Cytotoxic molecules, especially granulysin, are expressed in the skin lesions of SJS/TEN and cause extensive keratinocyte death. It is postulated that the function of regulatory T cells (Treg) in SJS/TEN is inadequate. This study examined whether an immunohistological examination of cytotoxic molecules and the immunophenotype of Treg is useful for discriminating SJS from EMM in the early period. Over the past 9 years, the lesional skin of 14 patients with SJS/TEN and 16 patients with EMM was biopsied. Double immunofluorescence labeling of CD8 and granulysin, perforin, or granzyme B was performed, and immunohistochemical analyses of granulysin, perforin, granzyme B, CD1a, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68 and Foxp3 were conducted using a highly sensitive indirect immunoperoxidase technique. The number of cells positive for each antibody per five high-power fields was counted. The proportions of granulysin(+) cells/CD8(+) cells (P = 0.012) and perforin(+) cells/CD8(+) cells (P = 0.037) in SJS/TEN were significantly higher than in EMM. The number of Foxp3(+) cells/five high-power fields in SJS/TEN was significantly lower than in EMM (P = 0.004). Similarly, the number of CD4(+) cells/five high-power fields in SJS/TEN was significantly lower than in EMM (P = 0.0017). These data suggest that these panels of antibodies for labeling cytotoxic molecules, CD4 and Treg are useful for discriminating early SJS/TEN and EMM with a skin biopsy." ;

      dc:description "Matrix metalloproteinase-9 is implicated in airway inflammation and airway remodeling in asthma. We have previously confirmed that human rhinovirus-16 (HRV-16) infection increases MMP-9 expression both in vivo and in vitro. However, the role of the AP-1 sites within the MMP-9 promoter and the effect of commonly used asthma pharmacotherapies in modulating human rhinovirus (HRV)-induced MMP-9 production have not yet been elucidated. Experiments were performed in vitro in the human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cell line BEAS-2B and in primary HBE cells obtained from non-transplanted lungs. Using site-directed mutagenesis approaches, AP-1 sites were found to be necessary for HRV-induced MMP-9 promoter drive. EMSAs and supershift assays identified complexes consisting of Fos-related Ag-1 (Fra-1) in addition to other AP-1 subunits. Small interfering RNA approaches indicated that Fra-1 was induced upon HRV-16 infection in BEAS-2B cells and was necessary for MMP-9 expression in both BEAS-2B and primary HBE cells. Inhibition of MEK1/2 activity using PD98059 and U0126 reduced Fra-1 expression, DNA binding, MMP-9 promoter drive, and MMP-9 protein production. The long-acting β(2)-agonist formoterol and the glucocorticoid dexamethasone significantly reduced HRV-induced ERK phosphorylation, Fra-1, and MMP-9 expression in BEAS-2B cells. These data indicate that HRV-induced activation of the MEK/ERK MAPK pathway and Fra-1 expression are necessary for the upregulation of MMP-9 and can be modulated by two distinct but commonly used asthma pharmacotherapies. Together, these results offer insights into the mechanisms by which long-acting β(2)-agonists and glucocorticoids might reduce HRV-related asthma exacerbations." ;

      dc:description "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Nimesulide, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, on the growth of hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells (FaDu) in vitro, and investigate its potential mechanism. METHODS: After FaDu cells were treated with graded concentrations of Nimesulide for divergent time, sensitivity of cells to drug treatment was analyzed by MTT assay. Morphological changes of FaDu cells in the presence of Nimesulide were observed by acridine orange cytochemistry staining. Proliferating cells were detected using the 5-Bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) incorporation assay. Following cells were subjected to Nimesulide (500 mumol/l) for 6 h, 12 h and 24 h, the percentage of apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. We detected COX-2 and Survivin expression change by RT-PCR and Western blot, and analyzed the correlation of them with the growth of FaDu cells. Additionally, we also analyzed Caspase-3, Bcl-2 and Bax expressions as markers to investigate the related pathway of Nimesulide-indued apoptosis. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the viabilities rates were decreased by Nimesulide in time- and dose-dependent manners, typical morphological changes of apoptotic cells were observed in the Nimesulide-treatment groups, Nimesulide could suppress the proliferation of FaDu cells significantly. The percentage of apoptosis in FaDu cells were markedly increased after Nimesulide-treatment for 6 h, 12 h and 24 h. Nimesulide down-regulated the Survivin and COX-2 expressions at mRNA and protein levels in FaDu cells. Additional analyses indicated that Bcl-2 expression was significantly decreased and the expressions of Caspase-3 as well as Bax were increased at both mRNA and protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the induction of apoptosis and suppression of proliferation, Nimesulide could inhibit the growth of FaDu cells. Furthermore, the suppression of Survivin expression may play an important role in Nimesulide-induced growth inhibition. Nimesulide could act as an effective therapeutic agent for hypopharyngeal carcinoma therapy." ;

      dc:description "Celiac disease is a chronic small bowel disorder caused by an abnormal immune response to an array of epitopes of wheat gluten and related proteins of rye and barley in genetically susceptible individuals who express the HLA-DQ2/-DQ8 haplotype. Gluten peptides are efficiently presented by celiac disease-specific HLA-DQ2- and HLA-DQ8-positive antigen presenting cells to CD4(+) T-cells that, once activated, drive a T helper cell type 1 response leading to the development of the typical celiac lesion-villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia and intraepithelial and lamina propria infiltration of inflammatory cells. Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is a calcium dependent ubiquitous enzyme which catalyses posttranslational modification of proteins and is released from cells during inflammation. tTG is suggested to exert at least two crucial roles in celiac disease: as a deamidating enzyme, that can enhance the immunostimulatory effect of gluten, and as a target autoantigen in the immune response. Since glutamine-rich gliadin peptides are excellent substrates for tTG, and the resulting deamidated and thus negatively charged peptides have much higher affinity for the HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules, the action of tTG is believed to be a key step in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. This review is focused on the function of tTG in celiac disease, although it also deals with novel advances in tTG-based therapies." ;

      dc:description "Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is a recently described member of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family. It is produced by diverse cell types in response to a variety of stresses including hemorrhage and increased mechanical load. Though only relatively recently discovered, IL-33 has been shown to participate in several pathological processes including promoting type 2 T helper cell-associated autoimmune diseases. In contrast, IL-33 has been also found to have protective effects in cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies have illustrated that IL-33 attenuates cardiac fibrosis induced by increased cardiovascular load in mice (transaortic constriction). Since cardiac fibrosis is largely dependent on increased production of extracellular matrix by cardiac fibroblasts, we hypothesized that IL-33 directly inhibits pro-fibrotic activities of these cells. Experiments have been carried out with isolated rat cardiac fibroblasts to evaluate the effects of IL-33 on the modulation of cardiac fibroblast gene expression and function to test this hypothesis. The expression of the IL-33 receptor, interleukin-1 receptor-like 1 (ST2), was detected at the mRNA and protein levels in isolated adult rat cardiac fibroblasts. Subsequently, the effects of IL-33 treatment (0-100ng/ml) on the expression of extracellular matrix proteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines were examined as well as the effects on rat cardiac fibroblast activities including proliferation, collagen gel contraction and migration. While IL-33 did not directly inhibit collagen I and collagen III production, it yielded a dose-dependent increase in the expression of interleukin-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. Treatment of rat cardiac fibroblasts with IL-33 also impaired the migratory activity of these cells. Further experiments illustrated that IL-33 rapidly activated multiple signaling pathways including extracellular signal-regulated kinases, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinases and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) in a dose-dependent manner. Experiments were carried out with pharmacological inhibitors to determine the role of specific signaling pathways in the response of fibroblasts to IL-33. These experiments illustrated that the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinases are critical to the increased production of interleukin-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in response to IL-33. These studies suggest that IL-33 has an important role in the modulation of fibroblast function and gene expression. Surprisingly, IL-33 had no effect on the expression of genes encoding extracellular matrix components or on proliferation, markers typical of fibrosis. The major effects of IL-33 detected in these studies included inhibition of cell migration and activation of cytokine/chemokine expression. The previously reported inhibition of cardiac fibrosis may include more complicated mechanisms that involve other cardiac cell types. Future studies aimed at determining the effects of IL-33 on other cardiac cell types are warranted." ;

      dc:description "Rationale: Mutations in the SFTPC gene, encoding surfactant protein C (SP-C), are associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD). Knowledge of the intracellular fate of mutant SP-C is essential for the design of therapies to correct trafficking/processing of the proprotein and prevent formation of cytotoxic aggregates.Objectives: To assess the potential of a chemical chaperone to correct trafficking and processing of three disease-associated, mutant SP-C proteins. Methods: HEK293 cells were stably transfected with wild type (SP-C(WT)) or mutant (SP-C(L188Q), SP-C(exon4 ) or SP-C(I73T)) SP-C and cell lines with similar expression of SP-C mRNA identified. The effect of the chemical chaperone 4-Phenylbutyric acid (PBA) and lysosomotropic drugs on the intracellular trafficking to the endolysosomal pathway and subsequent conversion of SP-C proprotein to mature peptide was assessed.Measurements and Main Results: Despite comparable SP-C mRNA expression, proprotein levels varied greatly: SP-C(I73T) was more abundant than SP-C(WT) and localized to the cell surface whereas SP-C(exon4 ) was barely detectable; in contrast, SP-C(L188Q) and SP-C(WT) proprotein levels were comparable and a small amount of SP-C(L188Q) was localized to the endolysosomal pathway. PBA treatment restored trafficking and processing of SP-C(L188Q) to SP-C(WT) levels but did not correct mistrafficking of SP-C(I73T) or rescue SP-C(exon4). PBA treatment also promoted aggregation of SP-C proproteins, including SP-C(L188Q).Conclusions: This study provides proof-of principle that a chemical chaperone can correct the mistrafficking and processing of a disease-associated mutant SP-C proprotein." ;

      rdfs:comment """We obtained data on the influence of bLf, whose immunomodulant properties are now recognized, on  MDDC differentiation/activation. We found that bLF interferes with the activation of MD-DC induced by different TLR agonists, but not by T cell mediated signals. Although bLF did not significantly influence monocyte differentiation in DCs, we found that it markedly reduced the up-modulation of CD83, co-stimulatory and MHC molecules (i.e. CD80, CD86, MHC class I and II), and cytokine secretion (IL-12, TNF-? and IL-23) induced by LPS or polyI-C. Consistently with an impaired MDDC maturation, bLF exposed cells retained antigen uptake capacity and exhibited a lower capacity to promote T cell proliferation and Th1 polarization. Although bLF did not affect the phenotype of R848 activated MDDC, these cells exhibited a reduced capacity to produce IL-12 and TNF-? and to promote Th1 polarization, and retained antigen uptake capacity. In contrast, no major effects on the phenotypic and functional properties of CD40L activated MD-DCs were observed in the presence of bLF. Overall, these results provide evidence for an antinflammatory role of bLF in the modulation of MDDC function, independently of its capacity to bind LPS (Puddu et al.). Of note, human recombinant Lf (Talactoferrin) has been shown to exhibit different effects on human MDDC, since exposure of these cells to talactoferrin provides an activation stimulus leading to enhanced Th1 responses and production of effector cytokines. These different effects are likely due to the recognition of different receptors, expressed in MDDC by talactoferrin and bLf.

Future studies will focus on: 
(1a)  investigating bLf effects on DC activation  triggered by TLR agonists in terms of:
   i) migratory capacity, 
   ii) chemokine receptors expression (CCR5 versus CCR7), 
   iii) chemokine secretion; 
(1b) characterizing mechanisms underlying the capacity of bLf to attenuate inflammation and to define whether this property is linked to its function in the regulation of iron homeostasis; 
(1c) analysis of the cellular determinants involved in the interaction of MDDC with bLf as well as of their role in mediating the antinflammatory activity of bLf.""" ;

      dc:description "BACKGROUND: Asthma is associated with oxidant stress and diminished antioxidant defenses. Yet, the mechanistic role of oxidant stress and antioxidant supplementation in human asthmatics remains uncertain. We determined the effect of high doses of the antioxidant natural-source d-α-tocopheryl acetate for 16 weeks on allergen-induced airway oxidant stress, inflammation, and bronchial responsiveness to methacholine and allergen in atopic asthmatics in vivo. METHODS: Thirty-three mild atopic asthmatics underwent bronchoscopy with baseline bronchoalveolar lavage and segmental allergen challenge. The allergen-challenged airway was lavaged 24 h later. At least 3 weeks later, patients underwent inhaled challenges with methacholine and specific allergen. Volunteers took 1500 IU of natural-source d-α-tocopheryl acetate daily for at least 16 weeks. At the end of the treatment, the two bronchoscopies and inhaled methacholine and allergen challenges were repeated. F(2) -isoprostanes, specific markers of oxidant stress, and selected Th1 and Th2 cytokines were analyzed in the lavage fluid. RESULTS: Following supplementation of natural-source d-α-tocopheryl acetate, plasma concentrations of α-tocopherol increased and γ-tocopherol decreased. Both baseline and allergen-induced F(2) -isoprostanes significantly decreased, providing biochemical evidence for an antioxidant effect. Natural-source d-α-tocopheryl acetate reduced allergen-provoked concentrations of interleukin 3 and interleukin 4 and augmented levels of interleukin 12 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Natural-source d-α-tocopheryl acetate improved airway responsiveness to methacholine but did not alter airway reactivity to specific allergen. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of oxidant stress by natural-source d-α-tocopheryl acetate modulates allergic inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in human atopic asthmatics in vivo. These results need to be confirmed by a randomized placebo-controlled trial." ;

      dc:description "Many software tools for comparative analysis of genomic sequence data have been released in recent decades. Despite this, it remains challenging to determine evolutionary relationships in gene clusters due to their complex histories involving duplications, deletions, inversions, and conversions. One concept describing these relationships is orthology. Orthologs derive from a common ancestor by speciation, in contrast to paralogs, which derive from duplication. Discriminating orthologs from paralogs is a necessary step in most multi-species sequence analyses, but doing so accurately is impeded by the occurrence of gene conversion events. We propose a refined method of orthology assignment based on two paradigms for interpreting its definition: by genomic context or by sequence content. X-orthology (based on context) traces orthology resulting from speciation and duplication only, while N-orthology (based on content) includes the influence of conversion events. We developed a computational method for automatically mapping both types of orthology on a per-nucleotide basis in gene cluster regions studied by comparative sequencing, and we make this mapping accessible by visualizing the output. All of these steps are incorporated into our newly extended CHAP 2 package. We evaluate our method using both simulated data and real gene clusters (including the well-characterized α-globin and β-globin clusters). We also illustrate use of CHAP 2 by analyzing four more loci: CCL (chemokine ligand), IFN (interferon), CYP2abf (part of cytochrome P450 family 2), and KIR (killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors). These new methods facilitate and extend our understanding of evolution at these and other loci by adding automated, accurate evolutionary inference to the biologist's toolkit. The CHAP 2 package is freely available from http://www.bx.psu.edu/miller_lab." ;

We focused on the study of the response of MDDCs to the combined stimulation with TLR ligands and we observed that simultaneous activation of TLR4 and TLR8 signaling cascades results in a marked inhibition of the secretion of the proinflammatory chemokine CCL2 with respect to stimulation through a single TLR. This inhibition is specific for both CCL2 and TLR agonist combination and could represent a novel regulatory mechanism evolved to maintain immunological balance (Del Cornò et al.).

Future studies will focus on 
- characterizing the mechanism(s) by which cross-tolerance between TLRs induce different functional states of DCs that favour different T cell effector phenotypes. Moreover, a further characterization of the molecular mechanisms underlying CCL2 regulation, will be also performed; 
- defining the role of selected miR on the differentiation/activation of MDDCs. """ ;

      dc:description "Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a key immune mediator regulating migration of immune cells to sites of inflammation. S1P actions are mediated by a family of five G protein-coupled receptors. Sensory neurons express many of these receptors, and in vitro S1P has excitatory effects on small-diameter sensory neurons, many mediated by the S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1). This study investigated the role of S1P in regulating the sensitivity of DRG neurons. We found that in vivo perfusion of the normal L5 DRG with S1P increased mechanical sensitivity. Microelectrode recordings in isolated whole ganglia showed that large- and medium-diameter cells, as well as small-diameter cells, increased firing in the presence of S1P. To further determine the role of S1PRs, we examined the effects of in vivo S1PR1 knockdown in the L4 and L5 sensory ganglia. Small interfering RNA directed against S1PR1 did not affect baseline mechanical sensitivity in normal animals, in which S1P levels are expected to be low. However, when the L5 ganglion was locally inflamed, a procedure that leads to rapid and sustained mechanical hypersensitivity, S1PR1 siRNA injected animals showed significantly less hypersensitivity than animals injected with scrambled siRNA. Reduced expression of S1PR1, but not S1PR2 or S1PR3, was confirmed with qPCR methods. The results indicate that the S1PR1 receptors in sensory ganglia cells may play an important role in regulating behavioral sensitivity during inflammation." ;

      dc:description "Coronaviruses induce in infected cells the formation of replicative structures, consisting of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes, where viral RNA synthesis supposedly takes place and to which the nonstructural proteins (nsps) localize. Double-stranded (ds)RNA, the presumed intermediate in RNA synthesis, is localized to the DMV interior. However, as pores connecting the DMV interior with the cytoplasm have not been detected, it is unclear whether RNA synthesis occurs at these same sites. Here, we studied coronavirus RNA synthesis by feeding cells with an uridine analogue, after which nascent RNAs were detected using click chemistry. Early in infection nascent viral RNA and nsps colocalized with or occurred adjacent to dsRNA foci. Late in infection the correlation between dsRNA dots, then found dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, and nsps and nascent RNAs was less obvious. However, foci of nascent RNAs were always found to colocalize with the nsp12-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. These results demonstrate the feasibility of detecting viral RNA synthesis by using click chemistry and indicate that dsRNA dots not necessarily correspond with sites of active viral RNA synthesis. Rather, late in infection many DMVs may harbor dsRNA molecules that are not (longer) functioning as intermediates in RNA synthesis." ;

This methodoly incorporates a unique sample preparation procedure based on 96 well plate complex sample trypsinization, a nano-LC-based peptide separation coupled to MSMS analysis sequencing. This procedure led us to the identification of 600 phagosomal proteins from murine DC phagosomes. An integrated software solution has been developed to analyse these results and to perform comparative analysis of phagosome proteomes obtained in various conditions. 

This methodology has been applied successfully to identify: 

a) a set of proteins specifically associated to phagosomes in DCs but not other phagocytes, such as macrophages, 
b) a set of proteins specifically recruited to phagosomes during DCs maturation induced by various Toll-Like Receptors.""" ;

By using 0.8 M sodium bicarbonate with 65 mM sodium carbonate as the water-jacket and placing on a 37 °C surface, the chip maintained osmolality shift and the pCO2 in the media reservoir stabilized within < 3 mmol/kg and 5.0% ± 0.2% over at least 24 hours.

While standard formats and software systems have been developed to represent and publicly share information about microarray experiments, existing computational solutions give limited support to the representation of the outcomes, experimental hypotheses or conclusions about biological questions that are dealt with in gene expression analysis. We propose an OWL-based model and a Semantic Web-based approach to address the issue. We show that the formalization of microarray-related knowledge has the potential to enhance the access and the sharing of gene expression data; it promotes the collaboration on analysing them and, in general, it can improve the achievements of the scientific community working in the field.

Co-cultures of IFN-DCs with zoledronate-stimulated gamma delta T lymphocytes were also performed. gamma delta T-cell activation, as demonstrated by their up-modulation of activation marker expression levels (e.g. CD25 and CD69), was observed. These studies demonstrated for the first time the existence of a bidirectional activating interaction between DCs and gamma delta T lymphocytes activated by aminobiphosphonates. These data suggest a potential adjuvant role of this early cross-talk in the therapeutic activity of aminobiphosphonate drug that are currently used as anti-tumor drugs. A further characterization of the functional activities of activated gamma delta T lymphocytes and the reciprocal activation of the IFN-DCs are currently in progress. 

In the context of a different research project, it was observed that GM-CSF can promote, in the absence of any other stimulus, the differentiation of human monocytes into dendritic cells. These GM-DCs are endowed with distinct immuno-stimulatory and migratory properties. In particular, GM-DCs are activated CD1a+ DCs expressing co-stimulatory molecules, MHC class I and II, able to induce the proliferation and IFN-gamma production of allogeneic T lymphocytes and to *migrate toward both inflammatory and homeostatic chemokines. Interestingly the responsiveness of individual donors to this DC-differentiation promoting activity of GM-CSF positively correlates with their basal expression level of GM-CSF receptor.

The results have been accepted for publication (Conti et al., EJI). The detailed protocol might be submitted to the knowledge portal.""" ;

We examined the preventive effect of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) in a mouse ALI/ARDS model induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were injected with LPS (10-20 mg/kg) with or without rhG-CSF pretreatment (250 mg/kg/d). Survival rate, cytokine mRNA expression, and pathologic findings were examined. RESULTS: The 96-h survival rate of the control group was 20%. Survival was significantly increased to 80% in rhG-CSF-treated animals. LPS-induced destruction of the alveolar structure was not observed in the rhG-CSF group. Pretreatment with rhG-CSF led to significantly lower mRNA expression of TNF-α and IL-1β in the lung 24 h after LPS administration and significantly higher IL-10 expression 96 h after LPS administration. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that treatment with rhG-CSF also prevented the up-regulation of TNF-α and IL-1β protein expression in alveolar macrophages. CONCLUSION: Treatment with rhG-CSF prevents the development of ALI/ARDS induced by LPS by affecting the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and may be promising in clinical applications." ;

To investigate this dynamic process and the contributions of both donor and host cells, we developed an ear skin graft model suitable for intravital imaging. We found that donor dermal dendritic cells (DCs) migrated rapidly from the graft and were replaced by host CD11b(+) mononuclear cells. The infiltrating host cells captured donor antigen, reached the draining lymph node and cross-primed graft-reactive CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, we defined the mechanisms by which host T cells target graft cells. We found that primed T cells entered the graft from the surrounding tissue and localized selectively at the dermis-epidermis junction. Later, CD8(+) T cells disseminated throughout the graft and many became arrested. These results provide insights into the antigen presentation pathway and the stepwise progression of CD8(+) T cell activity, thereby offering a framework for evaluating how immunotherapy might abrogate the key steps in allograft rejection." ;

      dc:description "The purpose of this study was to review the literature regarding the action of the cytokines interleukin 10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in pregnancy and to emphasize the factors that are of interest to clinical obstetrics. The literature highlights several actions of IL-10 and TNF-α during pregnancy. The actions of these cytokines seem to be antagonistic and dependent on the balance between them, which is orchestrated by the specific immunosuppressive action of IL-10. TNF-α has a characteristic inflammatory action, and it is an additional diabetogenic factor in pregnancy. The loss of the control of the production of these cytokines, with increase of TNF-α, is related to the risk for developing obstetric complications, particularly recurrent fetal loss, gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertensive syndromes, and fetal growth restriction. However, study results are controversial and are not clearly defined. These issues are attributed to the heterogeneity of the studies, particularly regarding their sample sizes and sources, the evaluation methods, and the multiplicity of factors and conditions that influence cytokine production. These questions are fundamental and should be addressed in future investigations to obtain more consistent results that can be applied to obstetric practice." ;

In this method, independent populations of cells are grown in medium containing different non-radioactive isotope forms of essential amino acids (e.g. arginine and lysine). Because the cells cannot synthesize these amino acids, after some generations all proteins are labelled and therefore can be distinguished and quantified by the mass spectrometer. To generate a proteomic map of DCs which includes quantitative information that can be used further to study signalling cascades it is also necessary to optimize the SILAC labelling of DCs.

In mice, the inability of the immune system to clear viral infections or inhibit tumor growth can be reversed by antibody-mediated blockade of IL-10 action. We used a modified selection protocol to isolate RNA-based, nuclease-resistant, aptamers that bind to the murine IL-10 receptor. After 5 rounds of selection high-throughput sequencing (HTS) was used to analyze the library. Using distribution statistics on about 11 million sequences, aptamers were identified which bound to IL-10 receptor in solution with low K(d). After 12 rounds of selection the predominant IL-10 receptor-binding aptamer identified in the earlier rounds remained, whereas other high-affinity aptamers were not detected. Prevalence of certain nucleotide (nt) substitutions in the sequence of a high-affinity aptamer present in round 5 was used to deduce its secondary structure and guide the truncation of the aptamer resulting in a shortened 48-nt long aptamer with increased affinity. The aptamer also bound to IL-10 receptor on the cell surface and blocked IL-10 function in vitro. Systemic administration of the truncated aptamer was capable of inhibiting tumor growth in mice to an extent comparable to that of an anti- IL-10 receptor antibody." ;

      dc:description "ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic properties and to be protective in animal models of osteoarthritis (OA). We have previously shown that interleukin-1beta (IL-1) down-regulates PPARgamma expression in human OA chondrocytes. However, the mechanisms underlying this effect have not been well characterized. The PPARgamma promoter harbors an overlapping Egr-1/specificity protein 1 (Sp1) binding site. In this study, our objective was to define the roles of Egr-1 and Sp1 in IL-1-mediated down-regulation of PPARgamma expression. METHODS: Chondrocytes were stimulated with IL-1 and the expression levels of Egr-1 and Sp1 mRNAs and proteins were evaluated using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting, respectively. The role of de novo protein synthesis was evaluated using the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). The recruitment of Sp1 and Egr-1 to the PPARgamma promoter was evaluated using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. The PPARgamma promoter activity was analyzed in transient transfection experiments. The roles of Egr-1 and Sp1 were further evaluated using small interfering RNA (siRNA) approaches. The level of Egr-1 in cartilage was determined using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Down-regulation of PPARgamma expression by IL-1 requires de novo protein synthesis and was concomitant with the induction of the transcription factor Egr-1. Treatment with IL-1 induced Egr-1 recruitment and reduced Sp1 occupancy at the PPARgamma promoter. Overexpression of Egr-1 potentiated, whereas overexpression of Sp1 alleviated, the suppressive effect of IL-1 on the PPARgamma promoter, suggesting that Egr-1 may mediate the suppressive effect of IL-1. Consistently, Egr-1 silencing prevented IL-1-mediated down-regulation of PPARgamma expression. We also showed that the level of Egr-1 expression was elevated in OA cartilage compared to normal cartilage. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that induction and recruitment of Egr-1 contributed to the suppressive effect of IL-1 on PPARgamma expression. They also suggest that modulation of Egr-1 levels in the joint may have therapeutic potential in OA." ;

      dc:description "Integrins are a family of heterodimeric glycoproteins on cell surfaces that mediate diverse biological events involving cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions (1). Integrins consist of an α and a β subunit and are important for cell adhesion and signal transduction. The αvβ3 integrin is the most prominent receptor affecting tumor growth, tumor invasiveness, metastasis, tumor-induced angiogenesis, inflammation, osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (2-7). Expression of the αvβ3 integrin is strong on tumor cells and activated endothelial cells, whereas expression is weak on resting endothelial cells and most normal tissues. The αvβ3 antagonists are being studied as antitumor and antiangiogenic agents and the agonists are being studied as angiogenic agents for coronary angiogenesis (6, 8, 9). The peptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) has been identified as a recognition motif used by extracellular matrix proteins (vitronectin, fibrinogen, laminin, and collagen) to bind to a variety of integrins, including αvβ3. Various radiolabeled antagonists have been introduced for imaging of tumors and tumor angiogenesis (10). Most of the cyclic RGD peptides are composed of five amino acids. Various cyclic RGD peptides exhibit selective inhibition of binding to αvβ3 (50% inhibition concentration (IC50), 7–40 nM) but not to αvβ5 (IC50, 600–4,000 nM) or αIIbβ3 (IC50, 700–5,000 nM) integrins (11). Various radiolabeled cyclic RGD peptides and peptidomimetics have been found to have high accumulation in tumors in mice (12, 13). From these developments, [18F]galacto-c(RGDfK) has been evaluated in a number of clinical studies for imaging of αvβ3 in cancer patients (14-18). Knetsch et al. (19) reported the development of 68Ga-1,4,7-triazacyclononane,1-glutaric acid-4,7-acetic acid-cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Lys) (68Ga-NODAGA-c(RGDfK)) for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of αvβ3 receptors in nude mice bearing melanoma tumors. 1-(1-Carboxy-3-carbo-tert-butoxypropyl)-4,7-(carbo-tert-butoxymethyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane (NODAGA(tBu)3) was used to prepare 68Ga-NODAGA-c(RGDfK). Dumont et al. (20) chelated NODAGA-c(RGDfK) with 64Cu to form 64Cu-NODAGA-c(RGDfK) for PET imaging of αvβ3 receptors in nude mice bearing human glioblastoma tumors. For evaluation as a PET imaging agent for αvβ3, 64Cu has been attached to c(RGDfK) via bis(carboxymethyl)-1,4,8,11-tetraazabicyclo[6.6.2]hexadecane (CB-TE2A) to form 64Cu-CB-TE2A-c(RGDfK). The CB-TE2A chelating agent is thought to be a more stable chelate for Cu." ;

Sclerosing Sertoli cell tumor is a rare sex cord stromal tumor variant, with 16 cases reported in the English literature. We present an unusual case of sclerosing Sertoli cell tumor in a 33-year-old Caucasian male, which was negative or weakly reactive using immunohistochemical markers typically positive in Sertoli cell tumors. The tumor was positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, CAM 5.2, vimentin, CD56, CK8, synaptophysin and S100, and negative for inhibin, calretinin, WT1, CD99, CD117, CK5/6, CK7, chromogranin A, placental alkaline phosphatase, neuron specific enolase, D2-40, smooth muscle actin, Melan-A, epithelial membrane antigen and carbonic anhydrase IX. This is the second reported case of a Sertoli cell tumor with reactivity limited to neuroendocrine markers and the first such case of the sclerosing variant. A literature review of sclerosing Sertoli cell tumor, including English and non-English literature, is described. Our case highlights that expected immunohistochemical markers may be negative, and awareness of antigenically unreactive tumors is needed to avoid confusion between Sertoli cell tumor and other entities." ;

      rdfs:comment """A functional analysis of anti-MAGE-3.A1 CTL clones derived from vaccinated patients (either ALVAC canarypox virus vector, peptide-pulsed DC or peptide vaccination +/- montanide adjuvant) who displayed tumor regression was done.  

The functional avidities of these CTL clones, evaluated in lysis assays, were surprisingly low, suggesting that high avidity was not part of the putative capability of these CTL to trigger tumor rejection. Most anti-MAGE-3.A1 CTL clones obtained after DC vaccination, but not after peptide or ALVAC vaccination, produced IL-10. Transcript profiling confirmed this result and indicated that about 20 genes, including CD40L, prostaglandin D2 synthase, granzyme K and granzyme H, were differentially expressed between the anti-MAGE-3.A1 CTL clones derived from patients vaccinated with peptide-ALVAC or with peptide-pulsed DC. These results indicate that the modality of vaccination with a tumor-specific antigen influences the differentiation pathway of the anti-vaccine CD8 T cells, which may have an impact on their capacity to trigger a tumor rejection response.""" ;

With its 17 faculties, institutes and research centers, it offers a wide range of teaching and conducts academic research in all major scientific disciplines. Biomedical sciences are among the most prominent research areas of UNIGE. For the management of European research projects and fellowships, UNIGE has set-up a European grants office (http://www.unige.ch/recherche/euresearch/index.html) working closely together with specialized accounting, legal and human resource support services.
The Faculty of Medicine is the second largest faculty of UNIGE. It is closely partnered with the University Hospital of Geneva (http://www.hug-ge.ch/) and consists of three sections, Fundamental Medicine, Clinical Medicine and Dental Medicine. The section of Fundamental Medicine comprises six departments focussing on research themes that have been attributed high priorities by the Faculty of Medicine on the basis of academic excellence and an outstanding scientific track record. The Department of Pathology and Immunology comprises 10 basic research teams and 5 affiliated groups from the section of Clinical Medicine. The majority of these groups concentrate on research in the fields of immunology and immunopathology.
To promote excellence in cutting-edge research, the Faculty of Medicine has made a major investment in the establishment and maintenance of numerous state-of-the-art core facilities. The latter notably include facilities that are directly relevant to research performed in DC-THERA (genomics, proteomics, high-throughput sequencing, animal housing, generation of genetically modified mice, flow-cytometry). 
The laboratory of Walter Reith has a longstanding interest and expertise in the transcriptional regulation of gene expression in cells of the immune system, with a particular accent on human and mouse antigen presenting cells, including B lymphocytes, macrophages and DCs. Experimental strategies applied routinely in his laboratory encompass standard molecular, biochemical and cellular techniques for analyzing transcriptional and post-transcriptional control mechanisms, the generation of transgenic and knockout mice to study the functional consequences of perturbing specific regulatory pathways in vivo, and high-throughput technologies for characterizing regulatory networks, including microarray gene expression profiling, and genome-wide ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq methods for study transcription factor binding and epigenetic chromatin modifications.""" ;

      dc:description "Ectopic sphenoid sinus pituitary adenoma (ESSPA) may arise from a remnant of Rathke's pouch. These tumors are frequently misdiagnosed as other neuroendocrine or epithelial neoplasms which may develop in this site (olfactory neuroblastoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma, paraganglioma, melanoma). Thirty-two patients with ESSPA identified in patients with normal pituitary glands (intact sella turcica) were retrospectively retrieved from the consultation files of the authors' institutions. Clinical records were reviewed with follow-up obtained. An immunohistochemical panel was performed on available material. Sixteen males and 16 females, aged 2-84 years (mean, 57.1 years), presented with chronic sinusitis, headache, obstructive symptoms, and visual field defects, although several were asymptomatic (n = 6). By definition, the tumors were centered within the sphenoid sinus and demonstrated, by imaging studies or intraoperative examination, a normal sella turcica without a concurrent pituitary adenoma. A subset of tumors showed extension into the nasal cavity (n = 5) or nasopharynx (n = 9). Mean tumor size was 3.4 cm. The majority of tumors were beneath an intact respiratory epithelium (n = 22), arranged in many different patterns (solid, packets, organoid, pseudorosette-rosette, pseudopapillary, single file, glandular, trabecular, insular). Bone involvement was frequently seen (n = 21). Secretions were present (n = 16). Necrosis was noted in 8 tumors. The tumors showed a variable cellularity, with polygonal, plasmacytoid, granular, and oncocytic tumor cells. Severe pleomorphism was uncommon (n = 5). A delicate, salt-and-pepper chromatin distribution was seen. In addition, there were intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions (n = 25) and multinucleated tumor cells (n = 18). Mitotic figures were infrequent, with a mean of 1 per 10 HPFs and a <1% proliferation index (Ki-67). There was a vascularized to sclerotic or calcified stroma. Immunohistochemistry highlighted the endocrine nature of the tumors, with synaptophysin (97%), CD56 (91%), NSE (76%) and chromogranin (71%); while pan-cytokeratin was positive in 79%, frequently with a dot-like Golgi accentuation (50%). Reactivity with pituitary hormones included 48% reactive for 2 or more hormones (plurihormonal), and 33% reactive for a single hormone, with prolactin seen most frequently (59%); 19% of cases were non-reactive. The principle differential diagnosis includes olfactory neuroblastoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, melanoma, and meningioma. All patients were treated with surgery. No patients died from disease, although one patient died with persistent disease (0.8 months). Surgery is curative in the majority of cases, although recurrence/persistence was seen in 4 patients (13.8%). In conclusion, ESSPAs are rare, affecting middle aged patients with non-specific symptoms, showing characteristic light microscopy and immunohistochemical features of their intrasellar counterparts. When encountering a tumor within the sphenoid sinus, ectopic pituitary adenoma must be considered, and pertinent imaging, clinical, and immunohistochemical evaluation undertaken to exclude tumors within the differential diagnosis. This will result in accurate classification, helping to prevent the potentially untoward side effects or complications of incorrect therapy." ;

MAPU contains several body fluid proteomes; including plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. Cell lines have been mapped to a depth of several thousand proteins and the red blood cell proteome has also been analyzed in depth. The liver proteome is represented with 3200 proteins. By employing high resolution MS and stringent validation criteria, false positive identification rates in MAPU are lower than 1:1000. Thus MAPU datasets can serve as reference proteomes in biomarker discovery. MAPU contains the peptides identifying each protein, measured masses, scores and intensities using a clickable interface of cell or body parts. Proteome data can be queried across proteomes by protein name, accession number, sequence similarity, peptide sequence and annotation information. More than 4500 mouse and 2500 human proteins have already been identified in at least one proteome.

      dc:description "The gene encoding a cutinase homolog, LC-cutinase, was cloned from a fosmid library of a leaf-branch compost metagenome by functional screening using tributyrin agar plates. LC-cutinase shows the highest amino acid sequence identity of 59.7% to Thermomonospora curvata lipase. It also shows the 57.4% identity to Thermobifida fusca cutinase. When LC-cutinase without a putative signal peptide was secreted to the periplasm of Escherichia coli cells with the assistance of the pelB leader sequence, more than 50% of the recombinant protein, termed LC-cutinase*, was excreted into the extracellular medium. It was purified and characterized. LC-cutinase* hydrolyzed various fatty acid monoesters with acyl chain lengths of 2 to 18, with a preference for short-chain substrates (C(4) substrate at most) most optimally at pH 8.5 and 50°C, but could not hydrolyze olive oil. It lost activity with half-lives of 40 min at 70°C and 7 min at 80°C. LC-cutinase* had an ability to degrade poly(ε-caprolactone) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The specific PET-degrading activity of LC-cutinase* was determined to be 12 mg/h/mg of enzyme (2.7 mg/h/μkat of pNP-butyrate-degrading activity) at pH 8.0 and 50°C. This activity is higher than those of the bacterial and fungal cutinases reported thus far, suggesting that LC-cutinase* not only serves as a good model for understanding the molecular mechanism of PET-degrading enzyme but also is potentially applicable for surface modification and degradation of PET." ;

      rdfs:comment """The Challenge of Cancer: Individual Cancers and Mutations

Every individual´s cancer is unique. Therefore, the most effective treatment is one customized to a particular cancer´s genetic configuration. Genetic mutations and chromosomal abnormalities are commonly associated with human cancers. Unfortunately, since the genetic mutations leading to the development of cancer are often random events, every patient's tumor can contain a unique repertoire of antigens. This characteristic of human cancer requires that each patient's immune system be able to recognize and target the specific antigens present.

To address the challenge of the unique genetic profile of each cancer and the genetic mutations of that cancer, Argos' Arcelis personalized immunotherapy technology for cancer captures the complete, unique genetic information of individual tumors, loads a patient's own dendritic cells with the total tumor RNA and uses these dendritic cells to trigger an appropriate immune response. The Arcelis iummnotherapy for cancer, is therefore, customized to the unique antigenic repertoire of each patient's tumor, equipping the immune system to recognize and fight that particular disease. This approach precludes the need to identify or isolate specific tumor antigens and enables targeting of unknown tumor antigens and treatment of patients from whom only a minute amount of tumor material can be obtained.

Creating a Personalized Cancer Product
Argos’ Arcelis immunotherapy for cancer starts with precursors of the patient's dendritic cells, which, when matured for the immunotherapeutic, are currently considered the most effective antigen-presenting cells within the immune system. Argos amplifies whole tumor RNA from each individual patient (whether from the primary tumor site, distant metastatic sites or from tumor cells present in circulation) and then transfects the same patient's dendritic cells with the patient's tumor RNA. This process offers the opportunity for most cancer types at any stage of disease to be target opportunities for the Company's cancer immunotherapy approach.

Unique Advantages
- Dendritic cells transfected with RNA-encoding tumor antigens have been shown to stimulate potent immune cell responses equal or superior to other competing approaches
- The Arcelis immunotherapeutic is completely autologous (derived from the patient’s body), potentially offering maximum safety with minimal side effects
- The Arcelis immunotherapeutic targets the entire antigenic repertoire of the tumor including ‘private mutations’ unique to that patient
- A single production run makes enough product to continuously treat the patient for several years
Production requires only a minute tumor specimen, allowing treatment both of earlier stage and later stage patients 
- Argos´ centralized, automated manufacturing process is optimized for ‘day-old’ monocytes, allowing for production that provides the flexibility to access patients and clinical sites nationwide 
- Formulation requires no specialized manipulation at the clinical sites, maximizing site participation (thaw in vial, load syringe, inject)

HIV & OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES
Chronic viral infections, such as those caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), are difficult to treat and often incurable. Argos is applying its Arcelis technology platform to transfect dendritic cells with patients’ own viral RNA antigens, promoting immune responses perfectly matched to the patient’s unique viral variants.

The Arcelis HIV process utilizes small plasma samples from infected patients to amplify large quantities of messenger RNA that encode selected viral antigens. This technique has the added advantage of amplifying the multitude of patient-specific viral variants evolving in the infected patient, allowing for the creation of a therapy perfectly suited to the individual. Therefore, the viral sequences presented to the immune system to recognize and attack are completely compatible with the virus that has infected the host. The simultaneous presence of autologous viral sequences and dendritic cells should result in a novel immune response, personalized to each patient, that potentially has a greater probability of success in controlling residual virus or a rebound of virus following the cessation of therapy.

Studies published in Nature Medicine and The Journal of Infectious Diseases have demonstrated how patient-specific immunotherapeutic approaches similar to Argos´ have the potential to be effective treatment for people with chronic HIV infection. Additionally, a Phase 1 trial of Argos´ HIV candidate AGS-004, presented at the 2008 International AIDS conference, demonstrated that AGS-004 achieved the trial´s primary endpoint of induction of T cells response to patient-specific HIV antigens. Click here

In October 2006, Argos was awarded a $21M National Institutes of Health (NIH) contract to develop its Arcelis HIV immunotherapy platform. In addition to determining the immunogenicity of the Arcelis HIV product currently in the clinic, the goal of the five-year contract is to subsequently develop then test in the clinic even more potent next generation product candidates.

Argos believes its Arcelis technology can also be used to create immunotherapies for other chronic infectious diseases that don’t respond to current treatments. Infections such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and herpes represent some of the largest and most significant areas of unmet medical need. In fact, any disease subject to immune surveillance is potentially addressable.

Unique Advantages
- The Arcelis immunotherapeutic can be comprised of any number of strategically selected viral antigens (chosen to not adversely affect the biology of dendritic cells) 
- Amplification of viral antigens includes patient-specific dominant and quasispecies (important for highly mutagenic viruses such as HIV and HCV) 
- Immune responses generated are 100% relevant for that patient 
- Production requires only a small plasma sample that can be obtained during leukapheresis 
- If virus escape occurs at some point post-treatment, the product can be ‘updated’ using a new plasma sample 
- Argos knows of no other dendritic cell-based technology that could feasibly produce an autologous anti-viral immunotherapeutic""" ;

      dc:description "In addition to antiasthmatic effect, the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT(1)) antagonist montelukast shows renoprotective effect during ischemia/reperfusion and cyclosporine-induced renal damage. Here, we proposed that montelukast protects against rhabdomyolysis-induced acute renal failure. Compared with saline-treated rats, at 48h following the induction of rhabdomyolysis using intramuscular glycerol (10ml 50% glycerol/kg), significant elevations in serum levels of urea, creatinine, phosphate and acute renal tubular necrosis were observed. This was associated with elevations in serum Fas, interleukin-10, tumor necrotic factor-alpha, and transforming growth factor-beta1 and renal malondialdehyde and nitrite and detrimental reductions in renal catalase and superoxide dismutase activities. The effects of rhabdomyolysis on renal functional, biochemical and structural integrity and the associated changes in cytokines and Fas levels were abolished upon concurrent administration of montelukast (10mg/kg i.p.) for 3days (1day before and 2days after induction of rhabdomyolysis). Alternatively, administration of the anti-oxidant, α-tocopherol (400mg/kg i.m.) for 3days, succeeded in alleviating renal oxidative stress, but had no significant effect on the circulating levels of most cytokines and partially restored kidney functional and structural damage. Serum level of interleukin-6 was not altered by rhabdomyolysis but showed significant elevations in rats treated with montelukast or α-tocopherol. Collectively, motelukast abrogated functional and structural renal damage induced by rhabdomyolysis via ameliorating renal oxidative stress and modulation of systemic cytokines and apoptotic factor production. The results of this work are expected to open new avenues for early prevention of rhabdomyolysis-induced acute renal failure using selective CysLT(1) antagonists such as montelukast." ;

Despite the significant advances in mass spectrometry, which has enabled much of proteomics, due to various analytical challenges so far no eukaryotic total cell proteome has been sequenced completely. An alternative approach is to purify single organelles or DC components in order to generate the proteomic data.

An additional problem is to obtain highly pure fractions of DC from crude population of untouched splenic cells with a purity of 70-80%. This includes several sophisticated steps for depletion of all unwanted cell types. The crude population of DC is divided into the three known splenic subsets (CD8+, CD4+, DN DC) using Fluorescence activated cell sorting (BD FACS Aria). This procedure allowed to obtain highly pure fractions of each subset. However, because DC are a very rare population, this method is very material- and cost-intensive. Furthermore, it is not surprising that the obtained cell numbers of each subset after isolation are below 107. However, these cell numbers should be sufficient for proteomic investigations. The proteomes of all three subsets using mass spectrometry is in progress.""" ;

Competing immune inhibition could limit the clinical efficacy of DC vaccination. In this phase II trial, metronomic Cyclophosphamide and a Cox-2 inhibitor have been added to a DC vaccine with the intend to dampen immunosuppressive mechanisms. Twenty-eight patients with progressive metastatic melanoma were treated with autologous DCs pulsed with survivin, hTERT, and p53-derived peptides (HLA-A2(+)) or tumor lysate (HLA-A2(-)). Concomitantly the patients were treated with IL-2, Cyclophosphamide, and Celecoxib. The treatment was safe and tolerable. Sixteen patients (57 %) achieved stable disease (SD) at 1st evaluation and 8 patients had prolonged SD (7-13.7 months). The median OS was 9.4 months. Patients with SD had an OS of 10.5 months while patients with progressive disease (PD) had an OS of 6.0 months (p = 0.048) even though there were no differences in prognostic factors between the two groups. Despite the use of metronomic Cyclophosphamide, regulatory T cells did not decrease during treatment. Indirect IFN-γ ELISPOT assays showed a general increase in immune responses from baseline to the time of 4th vaccination. Induction of antigen-specific immune responses was seen in 9 out of 15 screened HLA-A2(+) patients. In conclusion, the number of patients obtaining SD more than doubled and 6-month survival significantly increased compared to a previous trial without Cyclophosphamide and Celecoxib. A general increase in immune responses against the tested peptides was observed." ;

Various methods can be used for the introduction of nucleic acids into cells; magnetofection involves binding of nucleic acids to magnetic nanoparticles with subsequent exposure to an external magnetic field. Here we show that surface modified superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) with a combination of polyacrylic acid (PAA) and polyethylenimine (PEI) (SPIONs-PAA-PEI) proved to be safe and effective for magnetofection of cells and tumors in mice. Magnetofection of cells with plasmid DNA encoding reporter gene using SPIONs-PAA-PEI was superior in transfection efficiency to commercially available SPIONs. Magnetofection of murine mammary adenocarcinoma with plasmid DNA encoding IL-12 using SPIONs-PAA-PEI resulted in significant antitumor effect and could be further refined for cancer immuno-gene therapy." ;

Recent evidence indicates that noneosinophilic asthma phenotypes can be developed by both Th1 and Th17 cell responses when exposed to LPS-containing allergens. In this study, we evaluated the effects of airway activation of FPRs by their synthetic agonist, Trp-Lys-Tyr-Met-Val-D-Met (W-peptide), on the development of Th1 and Th17 cell responses in a noneosinophilic asthma mouse model. A noneosinophilic asthma mouse model was generated by intranasal sensitization with 10 μg of LPS plus 75 μg of OVA on days 0, 1, 2, and 7. Mice were then challenged with 50 μg of OVA alone on days 14, 15, 21, and 22. W-peptide was administered during the sensitization period, and immune and inflammatory responses were evaluated after OVA challenge. Lung inflammation after OVA challenge was partly abolished by airway activation of FPRs during sensitization. Maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and migration of DCs from the lung to lung-draining lymph nodes were inhibited by FPR activation. In addition, airway activation of FPRs inhibited allergen-specific T cell proliferation in the lymph nodes. Production of IL-12 and IL-6 (Th1- and Th17-polarizing cytokines) from lung DCs was decreased by airway activation of FPRs. This effect resulted in the inhibition of allergen-specific Th1 and Th17 cell responses. Airway activation of FPRs during sensitization effectively prevents the development of Th1 and Th17 cell responses induced by LPS-containing allergens via multiple mechanisms, such as inhibition of DC maturation and migration and the production of Th1- and Th7-polarizing cytokines." ;

A 6-week-trial was conducted on 40 male Comisana lambs, divided into four groups, fed maternal milk (MM), MR, MR with L. acidophilus supplementation (MRL) and MR with a mix (1 : 1) of B. animalis subsp. lactis and B. longum subsp. longum supplementations (MRB). Lambs fed MR containing a mix of bifidobacteria showed the highest in vivo cellular immune response to phytohemagglutinin, whereas MM and MRB showed the highest antibody response to ovalbumin. At day 11 of the trial, MRL displayed the highest value of Interleukin-10; differences disappeared among groups subsequently. Blood cholesterol levels in lambs fed MR containing L. acidophilus was almost halved compared with that found in MM and MR groups. Meat from artificially reared lambs was characterized by trans-11 18:1 and total conjugated 18:2n-6, whereas meat from the dam-suckled lambs was characterized by 14:0, cis-9 14:1 and 16:0.

      dc:description "The activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in vascular endothelial cells may be involved in vascular pathogeneses such as vasculitis or atherosclerosis. Recently, it has been reported that some amino acids exhibit anti-inflammatory effects. We investigated the inhibitory effects of a panel of amino acids on cytokine production or expression of adhesion molecules that are involved in inflammatory diseases in various cell types. The activation of NF-κB was determined in human coronary arterial endothelial cells (HCAECs) because NF-κB modulates the production of many cytokines and the expression of adhesion molecules. We examined the inhibitory effects of the amino acids cysteine, histidine and glycine on the induction of NF-κB activation, expression of CD62E (E-selectin) and the production of interleukin (IL)-6 in HCAECs stimulated with tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Cysteine, histidine and glycine significantly reduced NF-κB activation and inhibitor κBα (IκBα) degradation in HCAECs stimulated with TNF-α. Additionally, all the amino acids inhibited the expression of E-selectin and the production of IL-6 in HCAECs, and the effects of cysteine were the most significant. Our results show that glycine, histidine and cysteine can inhibit NF-κB activation, IκBα degradation, CD62E expression and IL-6 production in HCAECs, suggesting that these amino acids may exhibit anti-inflammatory effects during endothelial inflammation." ;

D1 cells will be stimulated with LPS and harvested at different time-points for GeneChip analysis and for tandem mass spectrometry-based analysis of the integral plasma membrane proteome. A protocol for obtaining highly pure integral membrane proteins has already been set up in the last two months in the lab of Paola Castagnoli in collaboration with the lab of Juri Rappsilber at IFOM. 

A pilot project has already been performed on untreated D1 cells and on D1 cells matured for 24 hours with LPS. The two protein sample are currently being analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry by the lab of Juri Rappsilber. Data will be compared with previously collected microarray data. 

From a purely immunological perspective, we will identify new genes that change their expression at the cell surface during DC maturation, that may serve as novel maturation markers or that may tell us something new about DC maturation. From a more systems biology perspective, we will determine the amount of correlation between transcriptome and proteome dynamic changes and reconstruct the first transcript-protein network of DC maturation.""" ;

      dc:description "An effective hemoglobin (Hb)-based blood substitute that acts as a physiological oxygen carrier and volume expander ought to stimulate erythropoiesis. A speedy replacement of blood loss with endogenous red blood cells should be an essential feature of any blood substitute product because of its relatively short circulatory retention time and high autoxidation rate. Erythropoiesis is a complex process controlled by oxygen and redox-regulated transcription factors and their target genes that can be affected by Hb physicochemical properties. Using an in vitro cellular model, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of erythropoietic action of unmodified tetrameric Hb (UHb) and Hb cross-linked with adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP), adenosine, and reduced glutathione (GSH). These effects were studied under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Results indicate that these Hb solutions have different effects on stabilization and nuclear translocation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha, induction of the erythropoietin (EPO) gene, activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B, and expression of the anti-erythropoietic agents-tumor necrosis factor-alpha and transforming growth factor-beta 1. UHb suppresses erythropoiesis by increasing the cytoplasmic degradation of HIF-1 alpha and decreasing binding to the EPO gene while inducing NF-kappa B-dependent anti-erythropoietic genes. Cross-linked Hb accelerates erythropoiesis by downregulating NF-kappa B, stabilizing and facilitating HIF-1 alpha binding to the EPO gene, under both oxygen conditions. ATP and adenosine contribute to normoxic stabilization of HIF-1 and, with GSH, inhibit the NF-kappa B pathway that is involved in the suppression of erythroid-specific genes. Proper chemical/pharmacological modification is required to consider acellular Hb as an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent." ;

      dc:description "In clinical practice it is possible to find patients with clinical signs suggestive of anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) who are persistently negative for the routinely used anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL). Therefore, the term proposed for these cases was seronegative APS (SN-APS). We investigated the clinical usefulness of thin-layer chromatography (TLC) immunostaining in detecting serum aPL in patients presenting clinical features of SN-APS. Sera from 36 patients with SN-APS, 19 patients with APS, 18 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 20 anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive subjects and 32 healthy controls were examined for aPL using TLC immunostaining. Anti-β(2) -glycoprotein-I, anti-annexin II, anti-annexin V and anti-prothrombin antibodies were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Eahy926, a human-derived endothelial cell line, was incubated with immunoglobulin (Ig)G fraction from SN-APS patients and analysis of phospho-interleukin (IL)-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) and phospho-nuclear factor (NF)-κB was performed by Western blot, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression by cytofluorimetric analysis and supernatants tissue factor (TF) levels by ELISA. TLC immunostaining showed aPL in 58·3% of SN-APS patients: anti-cardiolipin in 47·2%, anti-lyso(bis)phosphatidic acid in 41·7% and anti-phosphatidylethanolamine in 30·5%. Six of 36 patients showed anti-annexin II. Incubation of Eahy926 cells with IgG from SN-APS induced IRAK phosphorylation, NF-κB activation, VCAM-1 surface expression and TF cell release. TLC immunostaining could identify the presence of aPL in patients with SN-APS. Moreover, the results suggest the proinflammatory and procoagulant effects in vitro of these antibodies." ;

      dc:description "Previous studies revealed a significant production of inflammatory cytokines together with severe thymic atrophy and thymocyte migratory disturbances during experimental Chagas disease. Migratory activity of thymocytes and mature T cells seem to be finely tuned by cytokines, chemokines and extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Systemic TNF-α is enhanced during infection and appears to be crucial in the response against the parasite. However, it also seems to be involved in disease pathology, since it is implicated in the arrival of T cells to effector sites, including the myocardium. Herein, we analyzed the role of TNF-α in the migratory activity of thymocytes in Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) acutely-infected mice. We found increased expression and deposition of TNF-α in the thymus of infected animals compared to controls, accompanied by increased co-localization of fibronectin, a cell migration-related ECM molecule, whose contents in the thymus of infected mice is also augmented. In-vivo studies showed an enhanced export of thymocytes in T. cruzi-infected mice, as ascertained by intrathymic injection of FITC alone or in combination with TNF-α. The increase of immature CD4(+)CD8(+) T cells in secondary lymphoid organs was even more clear-cut when TNF-α was co-injected with FITC. Ex-vivo transmigration assays also revealed higher number of migrating cells when TNF-α was added onto fibronectin lattices, with higher input of all thymocyte subsets, including immature CD4(+)CD8(+). Infected animals also exhibit enhanced levels of expression of both mRNA TNF-α receptors in the CD4(+)CD8(+) subpopulation. Our findings suggest that in T. cruzi acute infection, when TNF-α is complexed with fibronectin, it favours the altered migration of thymocytes, promoting the release of mature and immature T cells to different compartments of the immune system. Conceptually, this work reinforces the notion that thymocyte migration is a multivectorial biological event in health and disease, and that TNF-α is a further player in the process." ;

Following the extensive proteomic analysis of immature and mature DC-derived exosomes, ICAM-1 was identified as the major protein on mature DC-derived exosomes, required for their functional activity. In order to functionally validate the proteomic data, the antigen-presenting function has been investigated. Exosomes bearing functional MHC-peptide complexes have been shown to be presented at the surface of recipient DCs as intact \"antigen-presenting microdomains\", without the need for internalisation and reprocessing by the DC. It has been shown that DCs express specific receptors for exosomes. Since ICAM-1 on exosomes is required for their ability to activate T cells via DCs in vitro, the role of Mac-1 and LFA-1 (the major ligands for ICAM-1) as potential receptors for exosomes has been investigated. A new role for LFA-1 on DCs as a receptor for exosomes has been proposed. " ;

One-hour immobilization of animals with simultaneous electrocutaneous stimulation was used as a model of acute stress. The stress was accompanied by accumulation of MDA (LPO end-product) in the sensorimotor cortex and amygdala of passive rats. Intraperitoneal administration of IL-4 (5 μg/kg) increased MDA content in the amygdala and hypothalamus of non-stressed rats with different behavioral activity. In the sensorimotor cortex of passive and, especially, active rats, a decrease in MDA level was observed after injection of this cytokine. Preliminary administration of IL-4 prevented LPO activation in the sensorimotor cortex of behaviorally passive animals observed after stress against the background of saline injection. Regional peculiarities of LPO under the influence of this cytokine can be determined by differences in both biochemical processes in the brain tissue and specific involvement of different emotiogenic structures in the formation of the stress response. The revealed differences in the effects of IL-4 on free radical processes in active and passive rats indicate peculiarities of immune mechanisms in animals with different resistance to the same type of stress." ;

From isolated lymphnodes obtained after surgery we could identify single DC after staining with Prussian blue for iron. We are in the process of analysing the T cell rosettes (activation stage) that surround these DC to get insight in the functional activity. 
It was also demonstrated that DCs transfected with RNA produce derived proteins in vivo in the lymph nodes.

Also efforts were spent to get further information on the dynamics of immature and mature DCs. We discovered (van Helden et al JI 2006) that podosomes are present in immature DCs but absent on highly migratory mature monocytes derived DCs. Interestingly, PGE2 treatment almost instantaneously resulted in the resolution of the podosomes, indicating that PGE2 mediated signalling is one of the earliest steps to induce a more migratory phenotype. Currently, we attempt to resolve the signalling pathway that is responsible for these phenotypical changes. Furthermore, we observed that the integrin LFA-1, while being active on monocytes is completely inactive on immature DCs. We discovered that this is not due to a downregulation of LFA-1 at the surface of the DC but rather to a different  organization at the cell surface. While on monocytes LFA-1 is organized in small nanosized clusters, on immature DCs LFA-1 is distributed randomly at the cell surface (Cambi et al Mol. Biol. Cell 2006)""" ;

      rdfs:comment """Our lab generated data on alternatives to the ‘classical’ maturation method (i.e. a cocktail of inflammatory cytokines) for moDC (e.g. ‘clinical grade reagents such as Ampligen TM and Hiltonol TM). Moreover the possibility to co-electroporate moDC with constitutively active TLRs and TAA encoding mRNA was persued. The in vitro charging of monocyte derived DC (moDC) with antigens has been optimised.  In contrast to previous studies, the electroporation of TAA encoding mRNA after in vitro maturation of the moDC resulted in a better electroporation efficiency and antigen presentation.  

We evaluated the capacity of mRNA-electroporated DC as a vaccine for immunotherapy. First, the early DC maturation kinetics and the effect of different lipopolysaccharide incubation periods on the phenotypic maturation profile of DC were determined. Next, we showed that either immature or mature DC are equally well electroporated and express and present the transgene at a comparable level after electroporation. We point out that the mRNA electroporation results in a negative effect on the interleukin (IL)-12p70, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion after maturation. Nevertheless, mRNA-electroporated DC induce an effective cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in vivo. Mature electroporated DC are significantly more potent in eliciting an Ag-specific CD8+ CTL response compared to their immature electroporated counterparts. In addition, a significant improvement in CTL response is obtained both in the primary and in the memory effector phases when CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg) are depleted in vivo prior to immunization. These findings are further substantiated in tumor protection experiments and hold convincing evidence for the merit of Treg cell depletion prior to immunization with mRNA-electroporated DC.

These results facilitate the preparation of DC-vaccines for clinical use. 

A single step procedure for the in vitro maturation and antigen loading of human moDC was optimized. DC were electroporated with mRNA encoding tumor antigens and a putative TLR3 ligand.  In vitro stimulation of naïve T cells indicated the superiority of this approach compared to in vitro stimulation with DC matured with inflammatory cytokines followed by electroporation with TAA encoding mRNA.""" ;

This method was applied to SELDI spectral data from 71 lung adenocarcinoma patients and 24 healthy individuals. Unlike other peak-selection-based methods, this method takes each spectrum as a unity. The aim of this paper was to demonstrate that this unity-based classification method is more robust and powerful as a method of diagnosis than peak-selection-based methods." ;

We will do this by applying a unique methodology dedicated to the identification of phagosome proteins in dendritic cells, under various experimental conditions, that we developed at the Curie Institute. This methodology incorporates a unique sample preparation procedure based on 96 well plate complex sample trypsinization, a nano-LC-based peptide separation coupled to MSMS analysis sequencing. This procedure led us to the identification of 600 phagosomal proteins from murine DC phagosomes. 

An integrated software solution has been developed to analyse these results and to perform comparative analysis of phagosome proteomes obtained in various conditions. This methodology has been applied successfully to identify: 
a) a set of proteins specifically associated to phagosomes in DCs but not other phagocytes, such as macrophages, 
b) a set of proteins specifically recruited to phagosomes during DCs maturation induced by various Toll-Like Receptors. 

In collaboration with Norman Pavelka and Paola Ricciardi-Castagnoli (P32), a special effort is put to understand the impact of transcriptome remodelling on phagosome proteome remodelling during DC maturation. This task requires the development of dedicated software solutions that are currently on the way and should open new possibilities for transcriptomic data analysis from the DC-THERA network.

      dc:description "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play critical roles in regulating various cellular functions by transcriptional silencing. MiRNAs can function as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors (oncomirs), depending on cancer types. In this study, using miRNA microarray, we observed that down-regulation of the Notch-1 pathway, by delta-tocotrienol, correlated with up-regulation of miR-34a, in non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLC). Moreover, re-expression of miR-34a by transfection in NSCLC cells resulted in inhibition of cell growth and invasiveness, induction of apoptosis and enhanced p53 activity. Furthermore, cellular mechanism studies revealed that induction of miR-34a decreased the expression of Notch-1 and its downstream targets including Hes-1, Cyclin D1, Survivin, and Bcl-2. Our findings suggest that delta-tocotrienol is a non-toxic activator of mir-34a which can inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, and inhibit invasion, thus offering a potential starting point for the design of novel anticancer agents. © 2012 Wiley-Liss, Inc." ;

      dc:description "With the completion of the human genome sequence, biomedical sciences have entered in the \"omics\" era, mainly due to high-throughput genomics techniques and the recent application of mass spectrometry to proteomics analyses. However, there is still a time lag between these technological advances and their application in the clinical setting. Our work is designed to build bridges between high-performance proteomics and clinical routine. Protein extracts were obtained from fresh frozen normal lung and non-small cell lung cancer samples. We applied a phosphopeptide enrichment followed by LC-MS/MS. Subsequent label-free quantification and bioinformatics analyses were performed. We assessed protein patterns on these samples, showing dozens of differential markers between normal and tumor tissue. Gene ontology and interactome analyses identified signaling pathways altered on tumor tissue. We have identified two proteins, PTRF/cavin-1 and MIF, which are differentially expressed between normal lung and non-small cell lung cancer. These potential biomarkers were validated using western blot and immunohistochemistry. The application of discovery-based proteomics analyses in clinical samples allowed us to identify new potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in non-small cell lung cancer." ;

We have immunized mice with human DC derived-exosomes and generated hybridomas that produce antibodies recognizing at least the human exosomes. Out of 20 hybridomas, only one appears to recognize specifically DC exosomes and not tumor exosomes nor autologous monocytes or DC or PBL. The Ab produced by this N°13 hybridoma is binding to a protein of about 30kDa. The proteomic analysis of human exosomes allowed us to suspect these proteins as a potential candidate target for our hybridoma 13:

- Signalling: 14-3-3 beta (28 kDa), 14-3-3 eta (28 kDa), 14-3-3 gamma (28 kDa), 14-3-3 zeta (28 kDa)
- Adhesion: CD9 (25 kDa), galectin 3 (27 kDa)
- Enzymes: glucose 6 phosphate isomerase (32 kDa)
- H2-M: MB2d (28 kDa), MB2k1 (28 kDa), MB2p (28 kDa), MB2q1 (28 kDa), MB2r (28 kDa), MB2w3 (28 kDa), MB2w5 (28 kDa)

      rdfs:comment """Agilent and Affymetrix data were obtained from an expression analysis of DC treated +/- poly I:C +/- kinase inhibitors. We have previously shown that activation of Src family kinases is absolutely required for cytokine production in DC stimulated by agonists of several Toll like receptors. Inhibition of these kinases by the specific inhibitors PP1/2 uncoupled cytokine production from the up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules in DC. 

We investigated gene expression profiles in DC stimulated with PolyI:C, pretreated or not with PP2, microarray analysis was performed. 41 genes were found to be strongly inhibited by PP2; some cytokines, chemokines and the transcription factor IRF-8 are among these genes. 38 genes were partially inhibited by PP2, and the IL-6 gene belongs to this second group. Other 67 genes were not inhibited at all by PP2. The presence of NF-kB inhibitor in this last group confirms that PP2 doesn’t affect the NF-kB pathway from which IkB transcription depends. Another interesting finding is that among the genes that are not inhibited by PP2 there is also the gene of IL-23. To investigate the role of src kinases on IL-23 production, we tested DC supernatants for the presence of IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines after 24 hours of stimulation with R848 (TLR7/8 agonist) or with Poly I:C (TLR3 agonist). We found that PP2 was able to impair IL-12 production, but it did not affect IL-23 production. On the contrary, the amount of IL-23 was higher in PP2-treated MoDC than in untreated cells, especially upon R848 stimulation.

The results obtained with Agilent arrays were compared with those from the Affymetrix platform.""" ;

The effectiveness of the dendritic cell (DC) vaccination protocols that are currently in use could be improved by providing the DCs with a more potent maturation signal. We therefore investigated whether the T-cell stimulatory capacity of human monocyte-derived DCs could be increased by co-electroporation with different combinations of CD40L, CD70, and constitutively active toll-like receptor 4 (caTLR4) encoding mRNA. We show that immature DCs electroporated with CD40L and/or caTLR4 mRNA, but not those electroporated with CD70 mRNA, acquire a mature phenotype along with an enhanced secretion of several cytokines/chemokines. Moreover, these DCs are very potent in inducing naive CD4(+) T cells to differentiate into interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-secreting type 1 T helper (Th1) cells. Further, we assessed the capacity of the electroporated DCs to activate naive HLA-A2-restricted MelanA-specific CD8(+) T cells without the addition of any exogenous cytokines. When all three molecules were combined, a >500-fold increase in MelanA-specific CD8(+) T cells was observed when compared with immature DCs, and a >200-fold increase when compared with cytokine cocktail-matured DCs. In correlation, we found a marked increase in cytolytic and IFN-gamma/tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) secreting CD8(+) T cells. Our data indicate that immature DCs genetically modified to express stimulating molecules can induce tumor antigen-specific T cells in vitro and could prove to be a significant improvement over DCs matured with the methods currently in use.""" ;

      dc:description "We found a novel type germline mutation at exon 11 of the c-kit gene, which results in a substitution of Tyr to Cys at codon 553 of the c-kit gene product (KIT-Tyr553Cys), in a 68-year-old female patient with multiple gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). In the present study, we carried out mutational analysis in her family members to determine the carriers and characterized the mutation by introducing the corresponding mutation (murine KIT-Tyr552Cys) into expression vector possessing murine c-kit cDNA. Mutational analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes of her family members revealed that a 44-year-old son had the same mutation, but at present he had neither apparent symptoms nor images of multiple GISTs. By transfection with the expression vector possessing the murine mutant c-kit cDNA, interleukin-3-dependent Ba/F3 murine lymphoid cells started growing autonomously without any growth factors, indicating that the mutation was considered to be of gain-of-function. Imatinib, a small molecule of tyrosine kinase inhibitor, effectively inhibited autophosphorylation of KIT-Tyr552Cys. Nilotinib, another small molecule of the KIT inhibitor, also effectively inhibited autophosphorylation of KIT-Tyr552Cys. In fact, proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing KIT-Tyr552Cys was effectively inhibited by both imatinib and nilotinib. These findings indicate that the novel type human KIT-Tyr553Cys mutation is the cause of the present familial and multiple GISTs, and that both imatinib and nilotinib might effectively inhibit the growth of GISTs developing in the patients of this family." ;

      dc:description "Reversion mosaicism is increasingly being reported in primary immunodeficiency diseases, but there have been few cases with clinically improved immune function. Here, a case is reported of X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1) with multiple somatic reversions in T cells, which restored sufficient cell-mediated immunity to overcome viral infection. Lineage-specific analysis revealed multiple reversions in T cell receptor (TCR) αβ+ and TCRγδ+ T cells. Diversity of the TCRVβ repertoire was comparable to normal and, furthermore, mitogen-induced proliferation of the patient's T cells was minimally impaired compared to healthy controls. In vivo and in vitro varicella antigen-specific T cell responses were comparable to those of healthy controls, although a reduced level of T cell receptor excision circles suggested that recent thymic output was low. During long-term evaluation of the patient's immunologic status, both the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and T cell proliferation responses were stable and the patient remained healthy. This case demonstrates that multiple but restricted somatic reversions in T cell progenitors can improve the clinical phenotype of SCID-X1." ;

A critical factor determining the effectiveness of currently used dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccines, is the DC’s activation or maturation status.  We have shown recently that the T cell stimulatory capacity of DCs pulsed with tumorantigen-derived peptides can be considerably increased by activating the DCs through electroporation with CD40L, CD70 and constitutively active TLR4 encoding mRNA (TriMix DCs).  Here, we investigate whether TriMix DCs can be co-electroporated with whole tumorantigen encoding mRNA.
The T cell stimulatory capacity of TriMix DCs pulsed with the immunodominant MelanA-A2 peptide and of TriMix DCs co-electroporated with MelanA mRNA was compared in vitro.  TriMix DCs were also co-electroporated with Mage-A3, Mage-C2, Tyrosinase or gp100 mRNA.  The capacity of these DCs to stimulate tumorantigen-specific T cells in melanoma patients, was investigated both in vitro prior to vaccination and after DC-vaccination.  
Like peptide-pulsed TriMix DCs, TriMix DCs co-electroporated with MelanA mRNA are very potent in inducing MelanA-specific CD8+ T cells.  These T cells have an activated phenotype, show cytolytic capacity and produce inflammatory cytokines in response to specific stimulation.  TriMix DCs co-electroporated with Tyrosinase are able to stimulate Tyrosinase-specific CD8+ T cells in vitro from the blood of non-vaccinated melanoma patients.  Furthermore, TriMix DCs co-electroporated with Mage-A3, Mage-C2 or Tyrosinase are able to induce antigen-specific CD8+ T cells through vaccination.
TriMix DCs co-electroporated with whole tumorantigen mRNA stimulate antigen-specific T cells both in vitro and through vaccination and thus form a promising new approach for anti-tumor immunotherapy.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """Our lab has obtained data on the molecular signatures for alternatively activated DC.

This type of activation characterizes the state of DC in certain pathophysiological conditions, such as during the resolution of inflammation as well as in chronic inflammatory conditions and in tumors. AA-DC were obtained by culturing immature DC in the presence of a maturative agonists (such as, LPS, CD40L or TNF) and calcitriol, IL-10 or prostaglandin E2. AA-DC showed a decrease in the production of IL-12 but retained most of the ability to secrete other cytokines, such as TNF and CXCL8. The hallmark of AA-DC was the production of the angiogenic cytokine VEGF in vitro, and in vivo when the cells were implanted into the chicken embryo CAM assay. VEGF production by DC was selectively observed only when the DC where alternatively activated. Therefore, VEGF production by DC can be considered a signature of this state of activation. AA-DC induced in the presence of LPS and IL-10 also produced high levels of the long pentraxin PTX3. PTX3 is pattern recognition receptor that plays a pivotal role in humoral innate immunity. DC produced conspicuous amounts of PTX3 when stimulated with LPS and this production is further increased in the presence of IL-10. However, PTX3 production was not increased in other alternative conditions of activation, such as in the presence of dexamethasone or calcitriol. PTX3 has properties similar to antibodies. Its production is induced by pathogen recognition, it recognizes microbial moieties, activates complement and facilitates recognition by phagocytes. Thus, this long pentraxin behaves as a bona fide ante-antibody. In this perspective, it is interesting that IL-10 stimulates B cell differentiation and antibody production. Thus IL-10 stimulates the humoral arm of both innate (PTX3) and adaptive (antibodies) immunity.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """The Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS) is the leading technical and scientific public body of the Italian National Health Service. Its activities include research, control, training and consultation in the interest of public health protection.

- Research and Trial
The Institute conducts scientific research in a wide variety of fields, from cutting-edge molecular and genetic research to population-based studies of risk factors for disease and disability. Research priorities are based on those set forth in the National Health Plan. The Institute is also involved in several major clinical trials, which are frequently conducted in cooperation with the Scientific Institutes for Research and Care (IRCCS) network and Hospitals.

- Inspection, Monitoring and Certification
An important activity of the Institute, which is mandated by the Minister of Health or the Regions, is certification of the chemical and biological purity of drugs and vaccines, as well as inspection and quality control of medical and diagnostic devices and equipment, food products and packaging. It monitors trends in disease, mortality and other health factors and provides technical support for health-related environmental surveys and for investigations of epidemics and other public health problems at national, regional and local level. It also supervises the laboratories engaged in the testing of prohibited substances in sport and the national veterinary institutes. Finally, it has an important role in monitoring and coordinating blood transfusion services and plasma production in Italy.

- Documentation, Information and Publications
The Institute serves as a major source of information relating to public health and biomedicine in Italy through online connections to national and international scientific databases and data banks. It also serves as the national reference centre for MEDLARS (MEDical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System), a comprehensive international data bank coordinated by the US National Library of Medicine (NLM). The Institute produces numerous publications, including a quarterly peer-reviewed journal, technical reports, a monthly newsletter describing the Institute’s major research activities, and a national epidemiological bulletin.

- Training and Scientific Meetings
The Institute plans, implements and evaluates training activities in a wide variety of areas, with courses designed to address the needs of the National Health Service. It develops and tests innovative training methods, including web-based distance learning. Training is provided for various categories of professionals; methods range from short courses and hands-on workshops to more structured and formal courses at national and international level. The topics addressed include health service management and evaluation, epidemiology and biostatistics, training methods, laboratory techniques, diseases control and priority public health issues, and health promotion. The Institute also organises congresses, conferences, workshops and seminars for national and international participants on fundamental public health issues linked to its institutional activities and research. These events are often organised in cooperation with international organisations such as the European Union, specialised UN Agencies and non-governmental organisations with which the Institute maintains close relations.

- International Activities
The Institute plans, implements and evaluates international health projects, ranging from cooperative research and development projects to humanitarian assistance. It actively promotes cooperation at three different levels of involvement: scientific partnerships with industrialised countries (USA, European partners, Japan); scientific and development projects in partnership with economies in transition (including China, South Africa, the Central Asian Republics and countries in Latin America, the Balkans and the Middle East); development partnerships in Africa and countries in turmoil, where humanitarian and technical assistance is provided in close collaboration with the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, various UN Agencies and the World Bank, as well as the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Several members of the Institute serve on panels of experts for the Fund as well as on other international committees and commissions. Current projects include research into the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS and poverty-related diseases, capacity-building for central health administrations, technology transfer in health management and technical support for national public health authorities, usually within the context of health care reform. There is growing interest and cooperation in the application of telematics to health issues, in keeping with the priorities recently established by the G8 and the Italian government.

      dc:description "Abnormal Ca(2+) -mediated signalling contributes to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the potential implication of calcium channel blocker in RA remained unknown. We hypothesized that nifedipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, combined with a calcineurin inhibitor, could suppress T cell activation via targeting different level of the Ca(2+) signalling pathway. The percentage of activated T cells and the apoptotic rate of mononuclear cells (MNCs) was measured by flow cytometry. The MNC viability, cytokine production, cytosolic Ca(2+) level and activity of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The NFAT-regulated gene expression, including interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN)-γ and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We found that the percentage of activated T cells in anti-CD3 + anti-CD28-activated MNC was higher in RA patients. High doses of nifedipine (50 µM) increased MNCs apoptosis, inhibited T cell activation and decreased T helper type 2 (Th1) (IFN-γ)/Th2 (IL-10) cytokine production in both groups. The Ca(2+) influx was lower in anti-CD3 + anti-CD28-activated MNC from RA patients than healthy volunteers and suppressed by nifedipine. When combined with a subtherapeutic dose (50 ng/ml) of cyclosporin, 1 µM nifedipine suppressed the percentage of activated T cells in both groups. Moreover, this combination suppressed more IFN-γ secretion and NFAT-regulated gene (GM-CSF and IFN-γ) expression in RA-MNCs than normal MNCs via decreasing the activity of NFATc1. In conclusion, we found that L-type Ca(2+) channel blockers and subtherapeutic doses of cyclosporin act additively to suppress the Ca(2+) -calcineurin-NFAT signalling pathway, leading to inhibition of T cell activity. We propose that this combination may become a potential treatment of RA." ;

      dc:description "Objective: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), or ecstasy, is a synthetic drug used recreationally, mainly by young people. It has been suggested that MDMA has a Th cell skewing effect, in which Th1 cell activity is suppressed and Th2 cell activity is increased. Experimental allergic airway inflammation in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized rodents is a useful model to study Th2 response; therefore, based on the Th2 skewing effect of MDMA, we studied MDMA in a model of allergic lung inflammation in OVA-sensitized mice. Methods: We evaluated cell trafficking in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, blood and bone marrow; cytokine production; L-selectin expression and lung histology. We also investigated the effects of MDMA on tracheal reactivity in vitro and mast cell degranulation. Results: We found that MDMA given prior to OVA challenge in OVA-sensitized mice decreased leukocyte migration into the lung, as revealed by a lower cell count in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung histologic analysis. We also showed that MDMA decreased expression of both Th2-like cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10) and adhesion molecules (L-selectin). Moreover, we showed that the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis is partially involved in the MDMA-induced reduction in leukocyte migration into the lung. Finally, we showed that MDMA decreased tracheal reactivity to methacholine as well as mast cell degranulation in situ. Conclusions: Thus, we report here that MDMA given prior to OVA challenge in OVA-sensitized allergic mice is able to decrease lung inflammation and airway reactivity and that hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activation is partially involved. Together, the data strongly suggest an involvement of a neuroimmune mechanism in the effects of MDMA on lung inflammatory response and cell recruitment to the lungs of allergic animals." ;

      dc:description "The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) controls the stability of most cellular proteins. The polymorphism of UPS-related genes is associated with major depression disorder, but less is known about the molecule that plays a role in depression by modulating the UPS. Melanoma antigen gene-D1 (MAGE-D1) interacts with RING E3 ubiquitin ligase and is implicated in protein degradation. MAGE-D1 may thus play an important role in the CNS via ubiquitylation. Here, we clarified a novel role of MAGE-D1 in emotional functions, namely its modulation of ubiquitylation to the serotonin transporter (SERT). The MAGE-D1 knock-out and knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in the prefrontal cortex showed depression-like behavior, such as a decrease in exploratory behavior in both the home cage and novel apparatus, a decrease in social interaction, increased immobility time during forced swimming and tail suspension, and a decrease in sucrose preference without any anxiety, or cognitive or motor dysfunction. Acute and chronic (28 d) administration of sertraline (10 mg/kg) and imipramine (20 mg/kg) reversed all or part of depression-like behavior in knock-out mice. In these mice, the serotonergic function in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus was hypoactive, accompanied by hyperexpression of SERT attributable to a decrease in ubiquitylation. Furthermore, MAGE-D1 binds to SERT via the necdin homology domain. MAGE-D1 overexpression in cells resulted in a decrease in serotonin uptake activity and the protein level of SERT but an increase in ubiquitylated SERT. Together, the present findings suggest a novel role for MAGE-D1 in depressive behaviors: modulating SERT ubiquitylation." ;

Our collaborative team has shown that it has potent anti-angiogenic, anti-cancer and anti-metastatic activities in vivo without observable side effects. We have documented evidence for KMKKT to alleviate drug-induced hematotoxicity in vivo. In the present study, we investigated the mechanistic and signaling events through which KMKKT enhances hematopoiesis, using hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) isolated from the bone marrow of 8-12 week-old C57BL/6 mice. Our results show that KMKKT significantly increased the expression of the hematopoietic cytokines interleukin (IL)-3, stem cell factor (SCF), granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), thrombopoietin (TPO) and erythropoietin (EPO) at the level of mRNA and secretion in HSCs. KMKKT also increased the expression of c-Kit, a cytokine receptor expressed in HSCs. In addition, KMKKT enhanced phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), and increased the binding activity of STAT5 to gamma interferon activated sites (GAS) that mediate JAK2 downstream signaling. Furthermore, we found that KMKKT significantly enhanced the growth rate of colony-forming unit granulocyte erythrocyte monocyte macrophages (CFU-GEMM) and burst forming unit erythroid (BFU-E) of mouse HSCs (mHSCs) stimulated by IL-3/EPO. Overall, our results demonstrated that KMKKT alleviated drug-induced side effects through enhanced hematopoiesis, at least in part through cytokine-mediated JAK2/STAT5 signaling." ;

      dc:description "Stable ectopic expression of Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase is usually performed in interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent murine cell lines like Ba/F3, resulting in loss of IL-3 dependence. Such high-level Flt3 expression has to date not been reported in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, despite the fact that oncogenic Flt3 aberrancies are frequent in AML patients. We show here that ectopic Flt3 expression in different human cancer cell lines might reduce proliferation and induce apoptotic cell death, involving Bax/Bcl2 modulation. Selective depletion of Flt3-expressing cells occurred in human AML cell lines transduced with retroviral Flt3 constructs, shown here using the HL-60 leukemic cell line. Flt3 expression was investigated in two cellular model systems, the SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cell line and the human embryonic kidney HEK293 cell line, and proliferation was reduced in both systems. HEK293 cells underwent apoptosis upon ectopic Flt3 expression and cell death could be rescued by overexpression of Bcl-2. Furthermore, we observed that the Flt3-induced inhibition of proliferation in HL-60 cells appeared to be Bax-dependent. Our results thus suggest that excessive Flt3 expression has growth-suppressive properties in several human cancer cell lines." ;

      rdfs:comment """Data has been obtained on the homing capacity of DC transfected with RNA encoding E/L-Selectin.

We have efficiently transfected DC with RNA encoding a functional protein (E/L-Selectin) which allows entry of DC into LN from HEV. Mouse E/L-S transfected DC, when given i.v.,  homed to LN, whereas non transfected DC home only to the spleen. The novel adherence capacity of human E/L-S transfected DC was demonstrated via sticking to sialyl-LewisX coated slides using a parallel plate flow microscope. RNA transfected human DC could be frozen and thawed without loosing their functionality. 

In an ongoing clinical trial (see WP9) using monocyte-derived and cocktail-matured DC electroporated with a combination of RNAs encoding tumor antigens (MelanA, Mage3, Survivin) and E/L-selectin, we already obtained superior immune responses using E/L-S+ DC compared to E/L-S- DC. 

To demonstrate in-vivo that multiple LN regions can be targeted by i.v. application of  E/L-S DC, we established indium111 labelling of DC and studied its effect on DC migration and T-cell interaction in vitro prior going into patients.  In terms of migratory capacity, which was analyzed using a transwell assay adressing CCR7-mediated migration of DC towards MIP3-ß, we could not find any inhibition by labeling of DC with indium111 up to 4 MBq (100 µCi). In contrast, priming and expansion of MelanA specific naïve CD8 T-cells by DC loaded with MelanA analog peptide or MelanA encoding RNA, was markedly affected by indium111 labeling in a dose dependent manner. Whereas MelanA specific T cell expansion was only slightly reduced using DC labelled with 1MBq of indium111, 2MBq  already completely abrogated specific T cell expansion and labelling with 4MBq even resulted in death of MelanA specific T cells. Therefore Indium111 labelled DC should not be loaded with tumor antigens if applied in patients, which may result in loss of specific immune responses at least at higher labelling intensities usually employed. Interestingly, this aspect had never been uncovered or considered in work done so far by other groups injecting Indium labelled DC previously.""" ;

Only when peptide pools as an antigen source are used PBMC exhibited a slightly higher stimulation capacity compared to whole blood. However, slightly higher background was observed when using PBMC to stimulate with antigen. Lowest background was observed when either peptides or protein were used for stimulation enabling assessment also of rare antigen-specific Th-cells below frequencies of 0.05% of peripheral CD4+ Th-cells. (Meier, Stark et al., 2008). We also tested usage of peptide pool preparations versus recombinant antigen for their stimulation capacity. While working with whole blood no differences in the capacity to elicit antigen-specific activation of Th-cells were observed, stimulation in PBMC induced higher activation (Meier, Stark et al., 2008). 
We also evaluated the influence of the cell density on the stimulation outcome when PBMC were used for induction of Th-cell activation. Optimal Th-cell activation was induced when cultures were initiated with about 5x10E6/ml PBMC.

The building offers 1,400 square meters of laboratory space including tissue culture rooms, level 2 and 3 biosafety laboratories, and an animal house. Core facilities are available for nucleic acid and protein analysis, cytofluorimetry, cell sorting, and high-resolution microscopy with image analysis. 

The IRB receives support from the city of Bellinzona, the Canton of Ticino, the Swiss Confederation, from private sources as well as from funding agencies. The Helmut Horten Foundation is the major sponsor with an initial contribution covering equipment and running costs for the first five years.

Providing extensive technical and logistic support, the institute offers optimal conditions for high-level research. This environment is expected to foster interaction and collaboration among the research groups, which are active in different areas of biology. The IRB strives to contribute to the progress of biomedical research by studying basic mechanisms of immune defense against bacteria, viruses and tumors, and to find new approaches to diagnostics and therapy.

Eight research groups are established under the guidance of Prof. Antonio Lanzavecchia and their number will grow up to twelve in the forthcoming years. An advisory board of eight internationally known specialists will guarantee standards of personnel appointments and research work. The topics of research range from cellular and functional aspects of the immune response to the molecular mechanisms of inflammation and innate immunity. Basic aspects of cell biology such as ligand-receptor interactions, intracellular signaling, protein structure and folding are also studied. Scientists at the IRB collaborate with several research institutes The IRB organizes seminars, scientific meetings and discussion groups. Moreover, the IRB provides support and training for graduate students from Switzerland and foreign countries.""" ;

      dc:description "Background:  Dermatological activity data has been collected for the same region of south-east Scotland (population of 1.24 million), approximately every five years, since 1981. This has allowed assessment of trends in demand from primary and secondary care, and activity within secondary care dermatology services, assisting planning of dermatological services. Objectives:  To quantify dermatology outpatient workload across the same population to allow comparison with previous studies for trends in practice. Methods:  During November 2010, a standardised proforma was completed for all National Health Service and private practice dermatology outpatient consultations. Demographic data, source and reason for referral, diagnoses, investigations, treatments and disposal were recorded, and comparisons made with five previous studies. Results:  5470 consultations were recorded: 2882 new and 2588 review patients (new:review ratio 1:0.9, male:female 1:1.3, mean age 49 years, range 1 month - 101 years). Ninety one per cent of referrals came from primary care and 9% from secondary care. Fifty eight per cent of referrals were for diagnosis and 32% for hospital management. Diagnostic concordance between referrer and dermatologist ranged from 97% for acne to 14% for melanoma. Benign tumours accounted for 30% of referrals, malignant tumours 13%, dermatitis 13.3%, psoriasis 6.2%, and acne/rosacea 5%. The referral rate rose to 23.2 / 1000 population per annum, with the increase coming mainly from primary care. Conclusions:  Demand for dermatology continues to increase: new referrals have risen by 134% in 30 years, with a 36% increase in the last 5 years, despite corresponding population increases of 5.3% and 3% respectively." ;

We found that CCR6–deficient (CCR6-KO) mice were resistant to induction of EAE but became susceptible when transferred with small number of CCR6-sufficient T cells. CCR6 was found to be required on a first wave of TH-17 cells that entered the CNS through the choroid plexus epithelial cells, which constitutively expressed CCL20 in both mice and humans. CCR6+ T cells triggered entry of a second wave of T cells that migrated in large numbers into the CNS by crossing activated parenchymal vessels. These results reveal distinct molecular requirements and anatomical sites of lymphocytes entry during development of EAE and suggest that the CCR6-CCL20 axis controls an evolutionary conserved pathway of immune surveillance in the brain." ;

Authorized for further training (DGfl-immunologist)

An institute dealing with one syndrome?
The DRFZ has the task to practise basic research in the field of rheumatic diseases. At the moment, 136 men and women work for the institute.
The DRFZ is the only institute in Germany with the exclusive assignment of interdisciplinary research on rheumatic diseases. When recommending an integration of the DRFZ into the Leibniz-Gemeinschaft in 2004, the scientific board emphasised the fact that it is one of the internationally leading institutes in the fields of immunology, experimental rheumatology and epidemiology. 
The concept of cellular pathology, formulated in 1855 by Rudolph Virchow, according to which diseases are caused by a malfunction of cells, is the overall concept of the DRFZ.
The understanding of this malfunction of cells involved in rheumatic diseases is the basic factor in the development of cell therapies at the DRFZ. With the help of those, cells can be treated directly by either correcting their malfunction, removing them from the body or destroying them when still in the body. 
In order to rebuild tissue affected by rheumatic diseases, cells with healing abilities have to be found and activated. The cellular and molecular understanding prepares the ground for effective therapies for rheumatic diseases. 
Our epidemiologists investigate factors influencing the course of inflammatory rheumatic diseases, evaluate the quality degree of medical care today and discuss the necessity of further improvements. This is put into practice in close cooperation with a network of more than 300 rheumatologists from all parts of Germany. In 1993 they started to build up a data bank for the treatment of patients which has become the largest in the world. Separately for adults and children it provides information about the actual state of medical care and possible deficits. More than 200.000 patients informed about their health situation, quality of life and the extend of their pain, some of them over a period of several years. The doctors collected and documented the corresponding medical data.   

Cooperation with other research groups
One important pillar of the DRFZ’s work is the close cooperation with other research groups. The scientists from the DRFZ work together in 11 working groups and 10 so called liaison groups, where they cooperate with colleagues from other institutes and from the Charité Berlin. In 1999 the German Research Council (DFG) installed the first special research sector at the Charité in which the DRFZ was involved. In the following years this was complemented by five more sectors integrated in the research groups of the DRFZ.
Furthermore, the DRFZ is involved in seven research networks of the EU. 
The DRFZ is one of the centres within the competence network “Inflammatory Rheumatic Diseases”, founded by the Federal Ministry of Science in 1998.
Abdreas Radbruch succeeded Henning Zeidler from Hannover and Gerd-Rüdiger Burmester from the Charité as the network’s spokesman and led it into its third funding phase in 2004/2005. In autumn 2005 Angela Zink, vice director of the DRFZ, became spokesperson of the competence network for 2006 and 2007. 
The project “Berlinflame”, a cooperation with partners from the Charité in 2001, made the DRFZ one of five national centres in the research sector “Infection and Inflammation” of the National Genome Research Network (NGFN). In the meantime the project has been renamed SIPAGE and prolonged until 2007.
In the funding programme “Tissue Engineering” of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research several groups of the DRFZ cooperate with partners from the Charité and companies for biotechnology.

Further information about all those projects can be found under “Research”.

Teachings
Through three confounded chairs supported by the DRFZ:
- “Experimental Rheumatology”, Prof. Dr. Andreas Radbruch
- “Clinical Rheumatology”, Prof. Dr. Falk Hiepe, and
-  “Epidemiology”, Prof. Dr. Angela Zink,  
the institute is closely linked to the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin.

Scientific Publications
The effective cooperation of scientists within the DRFZ as well as with partners from the Charité and other research institutes, not only in Berlin, is also reflected in the scientific publications. Most of the ca. 100 publications per year are co-authored by scientists from the DRFZ and those from other institutes. It is especially encouraging that the share of publications in highly estimated international journals like the Journal of Experimental Medicine, Arthritis and Rheumatism, Blood or the Journal of Immunology has constantly increased over the last few years.

He wanted to establish a university that would be independent from the state and the church and where academic freedom would reign. 
Although some courses at the ULB's Faculty of Law were already being taught in Dutch in 1935, it was not until 1963 that almost all the faculties offered courses in Dutch. The Dutch-speaking university was finally split off from its French-speaking counterpart on 1 October 1969. 

With the act of 28 May 1970, the Vrije Universiteit Brussel and the Université Libre de Bruxelles officially became two separate legal, administrative and scientific entities.""" ;

      dc:description "The present study was undertaken to identify and characterize chicken melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) from alternative translation initiation. The alternatively translated chicken MDA5 had an open reading frame of 3309 base pairs, shorter than the predicted chicken MDA5 sequence by 549 base pairs and longer than the recently published chicken MDA5 (GU570144) by 303 base pairs. The domain architecture was conserved among MDA5 molecules from various vertebrates. The alternatively translated chicken MDA5 shared high genetic identity to zebrafinch MDA5, but not to fish or mammalian MDA5. Various concentrations of chicken MDA5 transcripts were detected in different chicken tissues, with the highest concentration found in the intestine (1.4×10(10)copy/mg tissue). Chicken interferon (IFN-β) expression was dependent on the dose of pCDNA3.1-MDA5-long transfection in DF1 cells without double-stranded RNA stimulation. DF1 cells transfected with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) had significantly (p<0.05) increased fold changes in chicken MDA5 and IFN-β mRNA expression as compared to those in the controls. DF1 cells incubated with poly(I:C) did not have significant (p>0.05) changes in mRNA expression of chicken MDA5 and IFN-β. Chicken MDA5 mRNA level did not change significantly (p>0.05) in DF1 cells treated with imiquimod or bacterial DNA. The results indicate that although chicken MDA5 is phylogenetically different from mammalian MDA5, the domain architecture remains conserved. Chicken MDA5 can be detected in various tissues and functions to signal the activation of chicken IFN-β when overexpressing or being stimulated by poly(I:C)." ;

While they are characterized by a low proliferative response to T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 stimulation in vitro their responsiveness to activation through the 'co-stimulatory' CD2-receptor is enhanced when compared to PBT. In this study, we demonstrate that engagement of another co-stimulatory receptor on both LPT and PBT, namely CD28, by a single monoclonal antibody (mAb), respectively, strongly activates the former but not the latter through a PI3-kinase dependent signalling pathway leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-2, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In addition to the high sensitivity of LPT to CD2 stimulation, this finding supports the notion that 'non-specific/innate' mechanisms to activate T lymphocytes play a predominant role vis-à-vis'TCR driven/adaptive' responses in the intestinal mucosa. Furthermore, it suggests that results from preclinical tests for therapeutic antibodies performed with human blood derived T cells are probably insufficient to predict reactivities of tissue-resident immune cells, which - given their quantitative predominance - may critically determine the in-vivo response to such compounds." ;

The University of Zurich was founded in 1833, though its origins stretch back as far as 1525 and the days of protestant reformer Ulrich Zwingli. Today the University enjoys international renown as a place of education and research. Two thousand lecturers in 140 special institutes provide the broadest range of subjects and courses available from any Swiss seat of higher education. With 24,000 students and 1,900 graduates every year, Zurich is also Switzerland’s largest university. The University provides academic services, works with the private sector and considers itself part of a national and global network for the acquisition and dissemination of knowledge.

Zurich’s international reputation is based on groundbreaking research, particularly in molecular biology, brain research and anthropology, and on the work of the University Hospital and Veterinary Hospital.

The University’s researchers, lecturers and students benefit from the infrastructure that Zurich provides as a center of teaching and research. Apart from its own institutions, the University offers its members access to archive collections, libraries and the facilities of the Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), as well as to the city’s private institutions. Nine museums and collections, covering subjects from anthropology to zoology, constitute yet another valuable academic resource.""" ;

      dc:description "PURPOSEWe sought to evaluate the risk effect of tanning bed use on skin cancers among teenage and young adults. We also expected to determine whether a dose-response relationship was evident. PATIENTS AND METHODSWe observed 73,494 female nurses for 20 years (from 1989 to 2009) in a large and well-characterized cohort in the United States and investigated whether frequency of tanning bed use during high school/college and at ages 25 to 35 years were associated with a risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and melanoma. We used Cox proportional hazards models and carefully adjusted for host risk factors, ultraviolet index of residence, and sun exposure behaviors at a young age.ResultsDuring follow-up, 5,506 nurses were diagnosed with BCC, 403 with SCC, and 349 with melanoma. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of skin cancer for an incremental increase in use of tanning beds of four times per year during both periods was 1.15 (95% CI, 1.11 to 1.19; P < .001) for BCC, 1.15 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.31; P = .03) for SCC, and 1.11 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.27; P = .13) for melanoma. Compared with tanning bed use at ages 25 to 35 years, we found a significantly higher risk of BCC for use during high school/college (multivariable-adjusted HR for use more than six times per year compared with no use was 1.73 during high school/college v 1.28 at ages 25 to 35 years; P for heterogeneity < .001). CONCLUSIONOur data provide evidence for a dose-response relationship between tanning bed use and the risk of skin cancers, especially BCC, and the association is stronger for patients with a younger age at exposure." ;

      dc:description "Background. HLA class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) exert strong selective pressures on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), leading to escape mutations compromising virologic control. Immune responses continue to shape HIV-1 evolution after HAART initiation, but the extent and rate at which this occurs remain incompletely quantified. Here, we characterize the incidence and clinical correlates of HLA-associated evolution in HIV-1 Pol after HAART initiation in a large, population-based observational cohort.Methods. British Columbia HAART Observational, Medical Evaluation and Research cohort participants with available HLA class I types and longitudinal posttherapy protease/reverse transcriptase sequences were studied (n = 619; median, 5 samples per patient and 5.2 years of follow-up). HLA-associated polymorphisms were defined according to published reference lists. Rates and correlates of immune-mediated HIV-1 evolution were investigated using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models incorporating baseline and time-dependent plasma viral load and CD4 response data.Results. New HLA-associated escape events were observed in 269 (43%) patients during HAART and occurred at 49 of 63 (78%) investigated immune-associated sites in Pol. In time-dependent analyses adjusting for baseline factors, poorer virologic, but not immunologic, response to HAART was associated with increased risk of immune escape of 1.9-fold per log(10) viral load increment (P < .0001). Reversion of escape mutations following HAART initiation was extremely rare.Conclusions. HLA-associated HIV-1 evolution continues during HAART to an extent that is inversely related to the virologic success of therapy. Minimizing the degree of immune escape could represent a secondary benefit of effective HAART." ;

The IFN?-ELISPOT analysis and proliferation with its accompanying cytokine production revealed a strong and broad vaccine-induced T cell response. The strength of the immune response (defined as breath and magnitude of the response) was significantly higher in the patients with a complete remission (CR) than in the patients with no changes (NC) in the lesion size. Phenotypical anlaysis revealed a strong induction of CD4+ T-cells specifically against HPV16 E6 and E7, whereas CD8+ T cells were found merely against HPV16 E6 and to a less broad array of epitopes within each patient. This analysis was done after one in vitro restimulation, however, by directly ex vivo flow cytometric analysis hardly any CD8+ T cell response could be detected. The T cell cultures obtained from the biopsies taken of the last vaccination site were found to be HPV16 peptides specific in 3/5 tested NR patients and in 4/5 tested CR. However, recognition of the recombinant HPV16 E6 and/or E7 protein was observed in 1/5 cultures from NR patients and 4/5 cultures of the CR patients, suggesting the differences in vaccine-induced T-cell reactivity. Tissue biopsies of the VIN lesion before and after vaccination showed only in one patient a HPV16-specific T-cell response, which was against HPV16 E6 and merely of the type 2 cytokine producing T cells. Notably, no T-cell cultures could be obtained from VIN biopsies taken from the CR patients. In conclusion, the HPV16 E6 and E7 synthetic long peptides vaccine is highly immunogenic, in that it increases the number and activity of HPV16-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells to a broad array of epitopes in all patients. The expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-specific T-cells, both considered to be important in the anti-tumor response indicates the immunotherapeutic potential of this vaccine. Addition of a strong toll-like receptor ligand might increase the CD8 response in frequency and to a broader set of epitopes.""" ;

Patient care: routine care, high-level clinical care, and in particular, high-level reference care.
Research: both fundamental and bedside, healthcare-oriented research. 
Education for the faculties of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. 
Specialist medical training. 
Additional training, both post-doctoral and post-vocational. 

The LUMC comprises the Leiden University Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine of Leiden University. The LUMC, which employs approximately 7000 people, is located close to Leiden central station. 

The mission of the Leiden University Medical Center is to perform its core tasks at the highest possible level. Consequently, the LUMC aims to provide the best possible quality regarding both medical technology and patient care and treatment. The keywords are openness and information. 

With regard to research, the LUMC intends to maintain its position among the international elite with its centres of excellence and research focuses. The interaction of fundamental research and patient care forms the basis of our management policy. 

This means that the range of top clinical functions and reference tasks performed by the LUMC, many of them national or international, are built on a strong scientific foundation. In addition to its supraregional and national functions, the LUMC offers quality and quantity across the entire range of medical science. This is a must if the LUMC is to fulfil its public function as an innovator of healthcare and the healthcare system as well as its scientific role as a tester of new and existing medical technology. 

It goes without saying that the same applies to student teaching and specialist training. Clearly, there are some tasks the LUMC cannot, or does not wish to, perform on its own, so close collaboration with qualified general hospitals is required. Consequently, the LUMC continues to create and maintain networking structures in the fields mentioned earlier. In doing so, the 'appropriate use' of healthcare facilities remains a sine qua non. 

Through its teaching facilities, the LUMC will be turning out patient-centred doctors and scientists with a critical scientific attitude and the right dose of scientific curiosity. The gratification offered by academic pursuits is an essential ingredient. Further internationalisation of education is high on the list of priorities. 

Based on the principle of 'life-long learning', the LUMC's Boerhaave Committee plays a pivotal role of increasing importance as the largest post-academic medical training organisation in the Netherlands. 

The LUMC intends to even further consolidate this position, and to elevate the Leiden post-vocational training courses to the same level. Commitment to the team effort by each and every person working at the Leiden University Medical Center is a prerequisite for the realisation of these ambitions.""" ;

The aim of this study was to analyze the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical characteristics of 12 cases of primary nasal melanomas in Brazil. Twelve cases of primary nasal melanoma were analyzed histologically and by immunohistochemistry using the antibodies S-100 protein, HMB-45, Melan-A, CD63 (NKI/C3), CD68/KP1, fatty acid synthase (FASN), and Ki-67. The mean age of the patients was 60 years, and 7 of 12 patients were men. Microscopically, 10 cases presented level III of invasion; 4 were amelanotic; and in 7, cells were epithelioid. S-100 protein and FASN were positive in all cases, whereas 9, 8, 7, and 6 cases were positive for HMB-45, Melan-A, CD63 (NKI/C3), and CD68/KP1, respectively. Ki-67 labeling index ranged from 11.45% to 28.5% of positive cells. S-100 protein is more frequently expressed in nasal melanomas than in HMB-45, Melan-A, CD63 (NKI/C3), and CD68/KP1. FASN seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of nasal melanomas, and also, it can be helpful to confirm the diagnosis." ;

We investigated effects on systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and microvascular function (MVF) after controlled wood smoke exposure. METHODS: In a randomised, double-blinded, cross-over study 20 non-smoking atopic subjects were exposed at rest to 14, 220, or 354 mug/m3 of particles from a well-burning modern wood stove for 3 h in a climate controlled chamber with 2 week intervals. We investigated the level of oxidatively damaged DNA, inflammatory markers and adhesion molecules before and 0, 6 and 20 h after exposure. Six h after exposure we measured MVF non-invasively by digital peripheral artery tonometry following arm ischemia. RESULTS: The MVF score was unaltered after inhalation of clean air (1.58 +/- 0.07; mean +/- SEM), low (1.51 +/- 0.07) or high (1.61 +/- 0.09) concentrations of wood smoke particles in atopic subjects, whereas unexposed non-atopic subjects had higher score (1.91 +/- 0.09). The level of oxidatively damaged DNA, mRNA of ITGAL, CCL2, TNF, IL6, IL8, HMOX1, and OGG1 and surface marker molecules ICAM1, ITGAL and L-selectin in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were not affected by inhalation of wood smoke particles. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to wood smoke had no effect on markers of oxidative stress, DNA damage, cell adhesion, cytokines or MVF in atopic subjects." ;

      rdfs:comment """The name \"San Raffaele\" originates from the Hebrew word Raf-el, which means \"God’s medicine\" or \"God heals\". The San Raffaele hospital is a private Scientific Institute, belonging to the San Raffaele del Monte Tabor Foundation, recognised by the Italian Ministry of Health as a Scientific Institute carrying out biomedical research and clinical activities of relevant national interest (IRCCS). According to the inspiring principles of its founding Organisation, the mission of the San Raffaele is to cure and assist diseased individuals, following the Gospel proposition: \"Go, teach, heal\". Such a mission is accomplished by focusing every aspect of the Institute’s activities on Man, viewed as an multifaceted entity endowed with inseparable biological, psychological and spiritual elements.

San Raffaele Institute is relentlessly pursuing its three interrelated lines of clinics, research and education since 1971 when it was established and represented one of the first examples of a fully independent private hospital in Italy. Shortly after its foundation San Raffaele was granted the status of IRCCS (Research Hospital), which favoured its development as a site for clinical research, originally specialized in diabetes and metabolic disorders. 

In 1992 San Raffaele expanded further with the inauguration of DIBIT, a building dedicated to basic science, with a research space of about 12,000 square meters where at present 250 people are employed in basic, translational and clinical research, including scientists, technicians and administrative personnel, along with additional 300 fellows, consultants, trainees and graduate students. DIBIT is part of the largest biomedical science park in Italy, which includes San Raffaele Hospital with more than 1300 beds, Science Park Raf, created to support the Foundation’s development objectives, and the University Vita-Salute San Raffaele.  

The University Vita-Salute San Raffaele was established in 1996 and now hosts the Faculties of Medicine, of Psychology and of Philosophy. Further, the teaching activities include, besides a whole range of Schools of Specialization in different medical branches, international Ph.D. programs in Cellular and Molecular Biology and in Molecular Medicine. 

Within 2007, the DIBIT-2 project will expand almost three-fold the floor space devoted to research and will substantially increase and empower research in the different fields where San Raffaele has become highly renowned. Considering the interactions that DIBIT entails with San Raffaele Hospital, Science Park Raf and the University it is highly plausible to believe that in turn this expansion will allow to improve logistic and organization, to rationalize clinical activity, to catalyse industrial attention and to attract the best students.

Much effort and many resources have been invested in basic, preclinical and clinical research. Our scientific production continues to show quite an impressive progress in terms of both number of publications and overall quality. In 2006, 678 scientific papers were published, with a total impact factor of 3400. These figures confirm the Institute’s leading position in Italy, strongly support the ability to attract support from public (Ministry of Health, Superior Institute of Health, Ministry of University and Research, European Community, NIH and, for a small amount, CNR) and from private sources as well including charity foundations (mainly Telethon, the Italian Association for Cancer Research and Bank Foundations) and are the basis for the solid international reputation acquired over the years. Telethon is funding two research centers at San Raffaele: the San Raffaele-Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy of Genetic Disease (HSR-TIGET) which is pioneering the clinical application of gene transfer technology and the Stem Cell Research Institute (SCRI), which studies the biology and the potential clinical applications of stem cells, a field in which San Raffaele Institute is a world leader.

In the last few years the explosive development and diversification of biomedical technologies, by allowing impressive achievements such as the complete sequencing of the human genome, have revolutionized our approach to medical problems and radically modified the scientific scenario thereby opening the doors to a new type of medicine: “molecular medicine”. In the near future researchers’ efforts will be dedicated to the elucidation of the mechanisms of regulation and expression of different genes and the definition of the functions of their products, to the development of new diagnostic tools able to allow early and presymptomatic diagnosis and to the design of more appropriate, biologically-based and possibly individually-tailored therapeutic approaches. 

San Raffaele Scientific Institute has championed from the very beginning this new type of medicine, whereby basic researchers, clinical investigators and physicians operate together to translate basic research into medical practice, which means to develop molecular endpoints in clinical material and use them to develop pilot studies or clinical trials with the goal of providing both acceleration of cure and optimisation of care. In 2001, San Raffaele Institute was acknowledged, by the Health Minister, as the IRCCS for Molecular Medicine. 

Thanks to the effort and enthusiasm of scientists, physicians, students and of all the people working at San Raffaele, our new molecular medicine center will provide, in the immediate future, either new or less intrusive diagnostic and therapeutical approaches, ready to use within the public Italian health system.""" ;

      dc:description "OBJECTIVE:: Increased plasma concentrations of the endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, asymmetric dimethylarginine, decreased arginine bioavailability, and mitochondrial dysfunction have been reported in adult sepsis. We studied whether asymmetric dimethylarginine, arginine, and carnitine metabolism (a measure of mitochondrial dysfunction) are altered in pediatric sepsis and whether these are clinically useful biomarkers. DESIGN:: Prospective, observational study. SETTING:: Pediatric intensive care unit at an academic medical center. PATIENTS:: Ninety patients ≤18 yrs old, 30 with severe sepsis or septic shock, compared with 30 age-matched febrile and 30 age-matched healthy control subjects. INTERVENTIONS:: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: Plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine and whole blood arginine, citrulline, ornithine, and acylcarnitine:free carnitine ratio were measured daily for septic patients and once for control subjects using tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine concentration (median; interquartile range μmol/L) on day 1 was lower in severe sepsis and septic shock (0.38; 0.30-0.56) compared with febrile (0.45; 0.40-0.59) and healthy (0.60; 0.54-0.67) control subjects (p < .001), although decreased asymmetric dimethylarginine was predominantly found in neutropenic patients. Day 1 arginine was lower in septic (10; interquartile range, 7-20 μmol/L) compared with healthy patients (32; interquartile range, 23-40; p < .001), and the arginine:ornithine ratio was decreased in sepsis, indicating increased arginase activity (an alternative pathway for arginine metabolism). The arginine:asymmetric dimethylarginine and acylcarnitine:free carnitine ratios did not differ between septic and control patients. Asymmetric dimethylarginine was inversely correlated with organ dysfunction by Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score (r = -0.50, p = .009), interleukin-6 (r = -0.55, p = .01), and interleukin-8 (r = -0.52, p = .03) on admission. Arginine, arginine:asymmetric dimethylarginine, and acylcarnitine:free carnitine were not associated with organ dysfunction or outcomes. CONCLUSIONS:: Asymmetric dimethylarginine was decreased in pediatric sepsis and was inversely associated with inflammation and organ dysfunction. This suggests that inhibition of nitric oxide synthase by asymmetric dimethylarginine accumulation is unlikely to impact sepsis pathophysiology in septic children despite decreased arginine bioavailability. We did not find an association of asymmetric dimethylarginine with altered carnitine metabolism nor were asymmetric dimethylarginine, arginine, and acylcarnitine:free carnitine useful as clinical biomarkers." ;

Here, we suggest a novel type of tumor vaccines, with well-studied CTL epitopes presented on highly immunogenic virus-like particle (VLP) carriers. Cancer-germline gene MAGE-3 encodes for an antigenic nonapeptide (MAGE-3(168-176) peptide) that is recognized by CTLs on human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A1 and HLA-B35 molecules. A set of recombinant genes encoding hepatitis B virus core protein carrying MAGE-3 epitope was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli cells. Variants that led to formation of chimeric VLPs in vivo were purified and analyzed for their DNA binding properties in vitro. VLPs exhibiting the most pronounced nucleic acid binding affinity were selected and loaded either with single-stranded DNA oligodeoxynucleotides rich in nonmethylated CG motifs, or with longer double-stranded DNA fragments. Packaged DNA was protected, at least partially, against the action of bacterial DNase. Such highly purified chimeric VLPs with entrapped immunomodulatory sequences could possibly be used as antitumor vaccines." ;

      dc:description "Background. The lower tuberculosis incidence reported in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals receiving combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) is difficult to interpret causally. Furthermore, the role of unmasking immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is unclear. We aim to estimate the effect of cART on tuberculosis incidence in HIV-positive individuals in high-income countries.Methods. The HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration consisted of 12 cohorts from the United States and Europe of HIV-positive, ART-naive, AIDS-free individuals aged ≥18 years with baseline CD4 cell count and HIV RNA levels followed up from 1996 through 2007. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for cART versus no cART, adjusted for time-varying CD4 cell count and HIV RNA level via inverse probability weighting.Results. Of 65 121 individuals, 712 developed tuberculosis over 28 months of median follow-up (incidence, 3.0 cases per 1000 person-years). The HR for tuberculosis for cART versus no cART was 0.56 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-0.72) overall, 1.04 (95% CI, 0.64-1.68) for individuals aged >50 years, and 1.46 (95% CI, 0.70-3.04) for people with a CD4 cell count of <50 cells/μL. Compared with people who had not started cART, HRs differed by time since cART initiation: 1.36 (95% CI, 0.98-1.89) for initiation <3 months ago and 0.44 (95% CI, 0.34-0.58) for initiation ≥3 months ago. Compared with people who had not initiated cART, HRs <3 months after cART initiation were 0.67 (95% CI, 0.38-1.18), 1.51 (95% CI, 0.98-2.31), and 3.20 (95% CI, 1.34-7.60) for people <35, 35-50, and >50 years old, respectively, and 2.30 (95% CI, 1.03-5.14) for people with a CD4 cell count of <50 cells/μL.Conclusions. Tuberculosis incidence decreased after cART initiation but not among people >50 years old or with CD4 cell counts of <50 cells/μL. Despite an overall decrease in tuberculosis incidence, the increased rate during 3 months of ART suggests unmasking IRIS." ;

For applications in nanomedicine, it is necessary to modify the pRNA structure for the conjugation of active molecules. We have investigated endcapped double-stranded DNA segments as reversible capture reagents for pRNA. These capture agents can be designed to allow the conjugation of any desired molecule for pRNA functionalization. The results of model studies presented in this report show that 5- to 7-nucleotide overhangs on a target RNA can provide efficient handles for the high affinity association to capped double-stranded DNA." ;

The IFN?-ELISPOT analysis and proliferation with its accompanying cytokine production revealed a strong and broad vaccine-induced T cell response. The strength of the immune response (defined as breath and magnitude of the response) was significantly higher in the patients with a complete remission (CR) than in the patients with no changes (NC) in the lesion size. Phenotypical anlaysis revealed a strong induction of CD4+ T-cells specifically against HPV16 E6 and E7, whereas CD8+ T cells were found merely against HPV16 E6 and to a less broad array of epitopes within each patient. This analysis was done after one in vitro restimulation, however, by directly ex vivo flow cytometric analysis hardly any CD8+ T cell response could be detected. The T cell cultures obtained from the biopsies taken of the last vaccination site were found to be HPV16 peptides specific in 3/5 tested NR patients and in 4/5 tested CR. However, recognition of the recombinant HPV16 E6 and/or E7 protein was observed in 1/5 cultures from NR patients and 4/5 cultures of the CR patients, suggesting the differences in vaccine-induced T-cell reactivity. Tissue biopsies of the VIN lesion before and after vaccination showed only in one patient a HPV16-specific T-cell response, which was against HPV16 E6 and merely of the type 2 cytokine producing T cells. Notably, no T-cell cultures could be obtained from VIN biopsies taken from the CR patients. In conclusion, the HPV16 E6 and E7 synthetic long peptides vaccine is highly immunogenic, in that it increases the number and activity of HPV16-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells to a broad array of epitopes in all patients. The expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-specific T-cells, both considered to be important in the anti-tumor response indicates the immunotherapeutic potential of this vaccine. Addition of a strong toll-like receptor ligand might increase the CD8 response in frequency and to a broader set of epitopes.""" ;

      dc:description "Diffuse Large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) are the most prevalent of the non-Hodgkin lymphomas and are currently initially treated fairly successfully, but frequently relapse as refractory disease, resulting in poor salvage therapy options and short survival. The greatest challenge in improving survival of DLBCL patients is overcoming chemo-resistance, whose basis is poorly understood. Among the potential mediators of DLBCL chemo-resistance is the thioredxoin (Trx) family, primarily because Trx family members play critical roles in the regulation of cellular redox homeostasis, and recent studies have indicated that dysregulated redox homeostasis also plays a key role in chemoresistance. In this study, we showed that most of the DLBCL-derived cell lines and primary DLBCL cells express higher basal levels of Trx-1 than normal B cells and that Trx-1 expression level is associated with decreased patients survival. Our functional studies showed that inhibition of Trx-1 by small interfering RNA or a Trx-1 inhibitor (PX-12) inhibited DLBCL cell growth, clonogenicity, and also sensitized DLBCL cells to doxorubicin-induced cell growth inhibition in vitro. These results indicate that Trx-1 plays a key role in cell growth and survival, as well as chemoresistance, and is a potential target to overcome drug resistance in relapsed/refractory DLBCL." ;

This center of excellence is part of the Luminy science campus, that comprises fundamental research laboratories and biotech start-ups located between Marseilles and Cassis on the mediterranean coast.
Since 2004, the CIML has been relocated in one new and fully equipped 6.000 m2 building, the construction of which was possible thanks to the CNRS, Inserm, ARC, the city of Marseilles, the Bouches-du-Rhône County and the Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur Region.

230 people work at CIML. They are distributed among 20 research teams, administration, technical services and scientific common services including imaging, proteomics, transgenesis facilities and three scientific platforms: microscopy (PICsL platform), bio-optics (MOSAIC platform) and functional exploration of the mouse model (RIO-Marseille-Nice Genopole platform).

The main Immunology-based areas of research investigated by CIML teams are: ontogeny, lymphocyte and myeloid cell activation and differentiation, phagocytosis, host-pathogen interactions and cell death. 
Ciml 2000	 


The organization of the CIML is very unique in France. It is a federation of research teams, the size and the duration of which are limited. The Director is elected for a four-year term that can be renewed only once. Mutualisation of most of resources allows synergies and high-scale savings. Another specificity is that CIML has been successful in hiring researchers from foreign countries (eight group leaders are from abroad). In addition, long-term collaborative efforts have been established between CIML, universities, hospitals and private companies (four biotechs emerged from the work of CIML scientists: Immunotech, Innate Pharma, Ipsogen, Oz Bioscience).

The future of the Centre d’Immunologie is guaranteed by the presence of several modules of laboratories that have been kept empty for future new teams with scientific programs able to complement already on site studies and/or to bring forward more relationship with companies. CIML scientific activity is submitted to a strong evaluation system controlled by an external international Scientific Advisory Board working in close contact with the National Evaluation Committees from Inserm and CNRS.""" ;

In this study, we investigated the capacity of IL-12 to regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of human colon CSCs in vitro, as well as the effect of IL-12 on the growth of tumors initiated by CSCs in mice. After over-expression of IL-12 with lentiviral transfection, CSCs exhibited reduced invasiveness and tumorsphere formation in association with increased apoptosis in vitro. After injection into NOD/SCID mice, tumors initiated by CSCs transfected with IL-12 showed markedly reduced rate of growth. Mechanistic studies revealed that over-expression of IL-12 reduced the expression of IL-4 and STAT6 in CSCs. Thus, our study demonstrates a potentially beneficial role of IL-12 in directly limiting the malignant phenotype of CSCs." ;

      dc:description "Little is known about the function of natural IgM autoantibodies, especially that of IgM anti-leukocyte autoantibodies (IgM-ALA). Natural IgM-ALA are present at birth and characteristically increase during inflammatory and infective conditions. Our prior clinical observations and those of other investigators showing fewer rejections in renal and cardiac allografts transplanted into recipients with high levels of IgM-ALA led us to investigate whether IgM-ALA regulate the inflammatory response. In this article, we show that IgM, in physiologic doses, inhibit proinflammatory cells from proliferating and producing IFN-γ and IL-17 in response to alloantigens (MLR), anti-CD3, and the glycolipid α-galactosyl ceramide. We showed in an IgM knockout murine model, with intact B cells and regulatory T cells, that there was more severe inflammation and loss of function in the absence of IgM after renal ischemia reperfusion injury and cardiac allograft rejection. Replenishing IgM in IgM knockout mice or increasing the levels of IgM-ALA in wild-type B6 mice significantly attenuated the inflammation in both of these inflammatory models that involve IFN-γ and IL-17. The protective effect on renal ischemia reperfusion injury was not observed using IgM preadsorbed with leukocytes to remove IgM-ALA. We provide data to show that the anti-inflammatory effect of IgM is mediated, in part, by inhibiting TLR-4-induced NF-κB translocation into the nucleus and inhibiting differentiation of activated T cells into Th-1 and Th-17 cells. These observations highlight the importance of IgM-ALA in regulating excess inflammation mediated by both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms and where the inflammatory response involves Th-17 cells that are not effectively regulated by regulatory T cells." ;

      dc:description "Interferon (IFN)-γ is a cytokine with immunomodulatory properties, which has been shown previously to enhance the generation of tolerogenic dendritic cells (DC) when administered early ex vivo in 7-day monocyte-derived DC culture. To generate tolerogenic DC rapidly within 48 h, human monocytes were cultured for 24 h with interleukin (IL)-4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the presence (IFN-γ-DC) or absence of IFN-γ (500 U/ml) (UT-DC). DC were matured for 24 h with TNF-α and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2) ). DC phenotype, signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 (STAT-6) phosphorylation and promotion of CD4(+) CD25(+) CD127(neg/low) forkhead box P3 (FoxP3)(hi) T cells were analysed by flow cytometry. DC nuclear factor (NF)-κB transcription factor reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homologue B (RELB) and IL-12p70 protein expression were also determined. Phenotypically, IFN-γ-DC displayed reduced DC maturation marker CD83 by 62% and co-stimulation molecules CD80 (26%) and CD86 (8%). IFN-γ treatment of monocytes inhibited intracellular STAT6, RELB nuclear translocation and IL-12p70 production. IFN-γ-DC increased the proportion of CD4(+) CD25(+) CD127(neg/low) foxp3(hi) T cells compared to UT-DC from 12 to 23%. IFN-γ-DC primed T cells inhibited antigen-specific, autologous naive T cell proliferation by 70% at a 1:1 naive T cells to IFN-γ-DC primed T cell ratio in suppression assays. In addition, we examined the reported paradoxical proinflammatory effects of IFN-γ and confirmed in this system that late IFN-γ exposure does not inhibit DC maturation marker expression. Early IFN-γ exposure is critical in promoting the generation of regulatory DC. Early IFN-γ modulated DC generated in 48 h are maturation arrested and promote the generation of antigen-specific regulatory T cells, which may be clinically applicable as a novel cellular therapy for allograft rejection." ;

Experimentally naïve adult male Long-Evans rats were injected (intraperitoneal, ip) with either 200μg/kg LPS, 1.6mg/kg MDP, or 0.9% saline (Experiment 1), or 4.0mg/kg poly I:C or 0.9% saline (Experiment 2), 90min prior to treatment with 127mg/kg LiCl or saline control and immediately placed into a distinctive context for 30min (repeated over 4 conditioning days, spaced 72h apart). On a drug-free test day (72h following conditioning day 4), each animal was re-exposed to the context for 10min, and orofacial and aversive behavioral responses were video recorded and analyzed. The results showed that pre-treatment with LPS, MDP (Experiment 1), or poly I:C (Experiment 2) prior to LiCl+context conditioning significantly impaired the establishment of conditioned gaping behavior, thus blocking the acquisition of anticipatory nausea. Results varied in regards to peripheral acute-phase response sickness behaviors, with significantly reduced weight loss in LPS-treated animals, less robust weight loss in poly I:C-treated animals, and no significant reductions in body weight in MDP-treated animals. The learning impairments observed in the current study suggest that endotoxin treatment with bacterial and viral endotoxin may have stronger central effects on learning and memory behavior, relative to peripheral effects on body weight and other sickness-related responses." ;

      dc:description "Because IL-4 and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODNs) are immune stimulants, we evaluated the antitumor effects of IL-4 gene therapy and CpG-ODN treatment in a poorly immunogenic murine cancer model. We used a murine colorectal cancer MC38 cell line overexpressing the IL-4 gene (MC38-IL4). Incubation with MC38-IL4 and CpG-ODN enhanced bone marrow-derived dendritic cell (DC) maturation in vitro. In addition, interferon (IFN)-γ production was significantly increased in naïve splenocytes after they were coincubated with MC38-IL4 and CpG-ODN. When mice bearing MC38 wild-type tumors were inoculated subcutaneously with MC38-IL4 cells and CpG-ODN, the outgrowth of established parental tumors was significantly suppressed compared to those in the MC38-IL4-treated group (IL-4 vs. IL-4 + CpG-ODN, p=0.015). A marked infiltration of CD8+ cells in the established parental tumors of mice treated with MC38-IL4 and CpG-ODN was confirmed by immunohistochemical analyses (MC38-IL4, 2.8±1.9 cells/field vs. MC38-IL4 + CpG-ODN, 20.7±15.3 cells/field, p=0.027). Significant tumor-specific cytolysis was detected when splenocytes of MC38-IL4 + CpG-ODN-treated mice were stimulated by γ-irradiated MC38-IL4 cells and CpG-ODN twice weekly in vitro and used as effector cells in a chromium-release assay (32.2±3.5% for MC38 cells vs. 3.2±1.1% for YAC-1 cells; at an effector to target ratio of 40). These results suggest that IL-4 and CpG-ODN treatment promotes potent Th1-type antitumor immune responses. Therefore, the combination of IL-4 gene therapy and CpG-ODN treatment for cancer should be evaluated in clinical trials." ;

Using the dsRBDs, RHA binds to cellular and viral mRNAs, exports them from the nucleus, and regulates splicing as well as translational initiation. The RHA dsRBDs also reportedly mediate interactions with small RNAs and other dsRBD-containing proteins, and altogether form a processing complex involved in RNA silencing pathways. In addition, the RHA dsRBDs bridge RNA polymerase II with several transcription factors. Here we report the (1)H, (13)C, and (15)N chemical shift assignments of the dsRBDs of RHA. The resonance assignments obtained in this work will contribute to the elucidation of the interactions between RHA and transcriptional or post-transcriptional gene regulators." ;

      dc:description "The majority of cancers develop genetic and molecular strategies to resist conventional cytotoxic therapies as well as escape from the host's immune surveillance. These events lead to tumor persistence and spread through activation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) program and metastasis. Expression profiling analysis has revealed various tumor metastasis-inducing and metastasis-suppressing genes that regulate the metastatic process and maintain the microenvironment of the tumor cells. EMT in cancer entails the molecular reprogramming and phenotypic changes that characterize the conversion of immobile cancer epithelial cells to motile mesenchymal cells. A hallmark of EMT is the loss of E-cadherin, the epithelial homotypic adhesion molecule, and gain of mesenchymal markers such as vimentin and fibronectin. The molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation of EMT consist, in part, in the constitutive activation of survival signaling pathways such as the nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway. The NF-κB pathway has been implicated directly in the regulation of EMT and indirectly through the transcription and expression of several gene products that participate in the EMT cascade, such as Snail, the metastasis-inducer and E-cadherin suppressor transcription factor. In turn, Snail represses the metastasis-suppressor gene product Raf-kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) that inhibits both the Raf-1/MEK/ERK and NF-κB survival pathways implicated in EMT. Consequently, tumor cells normally exhibit a dysregulated NF-κB/Snail/RKIP circuitry that is intimately involved in the initiation of EMT and maintenance of drug resistance. Additional deregulated gene products in this circuit, such as the metastasis-suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN; repressed by Snail) and the putative-metastasis inducer Yin Yang (YY) 1 (target of NF-κB) also have been associated in the regulation of EMT. We recently have investigated the direct role of YY1 in the regulation of EMT. This review discusses the molecular regulation of EMT in cancer cells through the activity of the dysregulated NF-κB/Snail/ YY1/PTEN/RKIP circuitry. In addition, we propose YY1 as a potential novel prognostic biomarker for EMT and a therapeutic target for both the prevention of metastasis and the reversal of resistance." ;

      dc:description "The concept of Xp11.2 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) was recently established as a tumor affecting 15% of RCC patients <45 years. Many patients present with advanced stage with frequent lymph node metastases. Histologically, Xp11.2 RCC is characterized by mixed papillary nested/alveolar growth pattern and tumor cells with clear and/or eosinophilic, voluminous cytoplasm. Neoplastic cells show intense nuclear immunoreactivity to TFE3, while focal immunostaining for melanocytic markers, including melanosome-associated antigen or Melan A in some cases, are also noted. Alpha smooth muscle actin and TFEB are consistently negative. Ultrastructurally, the ASPL-TFE3 RCC variant contains rhomboid crystals in the cytoplasm, similar to that observed in alveolar soft part sarcoma. The fusion of the TFE3 gene with several different genes, including ASPL(17q25), PRCC(1q21), PSF(1q34), NonO (Xq12) and CLTC (17q23) have been identified to date. The behavior of Xp11.2 RCC in children and young adults is considered as indolent even when diagnosed at advanced stage, including lymph node metastasis. However, Xp11.2 RCC in older patients behaves in a more aggressive fashion. Therapy includes nephrectomy with extended lymphadenectomy. There may be a role for new protease inhibitors in advanced inoperable disease. Further research is required to correlate clinical behavior with the expanding genetic spectrum of this tumor, and to establish standard therapy protocols for primary and metastatic lesions." ;

      dc:description "Tumor regressions have been observed in a small proportion of melanoma patients vaccinated with a MAGE-A3 peptide presented by HLA-A1, administered as peptide, ALVAC canarypox virus containing a MAGE-A3 minigene, or peptide-pulsed dendritic cells (DC). There was a correlation between tumor regression and the detection of anti-MAGE-3.A1 CTL responses. These responses were monoclonal and often of a very low magnitude after vaccination with peptide or ALVAC, and usually polyclonal and of a higher magnitude after DC vaccination. These results suggested that, at least in some patients, surprisingly few anti-MAGE-3.A1 T-cells could initiate a tumor regression process. To understand the role of these T cells, we carried out a functional analysis of anti-MAGE-3.A1 CTL clones derived from vaccinated patients who displayed tumor regression. The functional avidities of these CTL clones, evaluated in lysis assays, were surprisingly low, suggesting that high avidity was not part of the putative capability of these CTL to trigger tumor rejection. Most anti-MAGE-3.A1 CTL clones obtained after DC vaccination, but not after peptide or ALVAC vaccination, produced interleukin 10. Transcript profiling confirmed these results and indicated that approximately 20 genes, including CD40L, prostaglandin D2 synthase, granzyme K, and granzyme H, were highly differentially expressed between the anti-MAGE-3.A1 CTL clones derived from patients vaccinated with either peptide-ALVAC or peptide-pulsed DC. These results indicate that the modality of vaccination with a tumor-specific antigen influences the differentiation pathway of the antivaccine CD8 T-cells, which may have an effect on their capacity to trigger a tumor rejection response." ;

      dc:description "BACKGROUND: Fatty acids (FAs) and adipokines such as adiponectin or interleukin-6 (IL-6) are known to modulate inflammation and the development of metabolic syndrome. Whether FA composition assessed in plasma triacylglycerols (TAGs), phospholipids (PLs) and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) and adipose tissue (AT) PLs differed between dysmetabolic and non-dysmetabolic severely obese women remains to be established. Whether the plasma and/or AT arachidonic acid (AA)/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ratio in the PL sub-fraction may be associated with adipokine AT gene expression needs to be examined. METHODS: FA composition was measured in plasma lipid classes and in the TAG and PL sub-fractions of subcutaneous abdominal and omental ATs of severely obese women paired for age and adiposity but showing a dysmetabolic profile (n = 13) or not (n = 14). FA profile was assessed by gas chromatography. Plasma and AT mRNA concentrations of adiponectin and IL-6 were measured by ELISA and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. RESULTS: Plasma adiponectin and FA concentrations in the NEFA sub-fraction were, respectively, lower and higher in dysmetabolic than in non-dysmetabolic women (p < 0.05). Despite similar FA levels in the PL sub-fraction, the AA/EPA ratio was higher in plasma and ATs (p < 0.005), because of an EPA decrease in plasma and subcutaneous abdominal fat vs. an AA increase in the omental depot. The AA/EPA ratio was negatively associated with adiponectin concentrations in plasma and subcutaneous abdominal AT (0.01 < p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic dysfunction is associated with a pro-inflammatory phospholipid AA/EPA ratio in plasma and ATs, and an altered adiponectin secretion that could contribute to developing metabolic syndrome." ;

      dc:description "We recently reported that overexpression of the elastase NEP (neutral endopeptidase) by fibroblasts plays a pivotal role in the mechanism of UVB-induced skin wrinkling by degrading dermal elastic fibres. Since UVB does not penetrate to the dermis, we hypothesized that factors secreted by UVB-exposed keratinocytes in the epidermis trigger fibroblasts in the dermis to increase their expression of NEP which then degrades the elastic fibres. In the present study, we characterized the epithelial-mesenchymal interaction between keratinocytes and fibroblasts which leads to increased expression of NEP. Human fibroblasts co-cultured with UVB-exposed human keratinocytes in cell inserts significantly increased their expression of NEP at the transcriptional, translational and enzymatic levels. Neutralizing antibodies to IL (interleukin)-1α or GM-CSF (granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor) significantly abolished the increased expression of NEP at the enzymatic levels in human fibroblasts co-cultured with UVB-exposed human keratinocytes, whereas neutralizing antibodies to IL-6, IL-8 or TNFα (tumour necrosis factor α) had no such effect. The addition of IL-1α or GM-CSF, but not TNFα, IL-6 or IL-8, at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 nM, significantly stimulated the expression of NEP in human fibroblasts at the transcriptional and translational levels. These findings suggest that IL-1α and GM-CSF are intrinsic cytokines secreted by UVB-exposed keratinocytes that stimulate expression of NEP by fibroblasts." ;

      dc:description "During Gram-negative sepsis, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and induces complex responses of immune system and coagulation. However, the underlying LPS signalling mechanism on coagulation activation remains complex. To determine the role of the intracellular signalling factors p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in the procoagulant response to LPS, coagulation process of human whole blood exposed to specific inhibitors was measured by thrombelastography. Samples were stimulated with LPS (100 μg/mL) after preincubation with BAY117082 (specific NF-κB inhibitor), SP600125 (specific JNK inhibitor), SB203580 (specific p38 MAPK inhibitor), or vehicle. SB203580 strongly inhibited LPS-induced coagulation activation, whereas BAY117082 and SP600125 showed no significant effect. Activation of p38 MAPK, NF-κB, and JNK and respective inhibitory effects were confirmed by Multi-Target Sandwich ELISA. In conclusion, activation of p38 MAPK is crucial for early LPS-induced activation of coagulation." ;

      dc:description "Transplant arteriosclerosis (TA) remains the major limitation of long-term graft survival in heart transplantation despite the advances in immunosuppressants. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been demonstrated to suppress allogeneic immune responses by numerous in vitro studies. However, the immunomodulatory effects of MSCs in vivo are controversial and the molecular mechanisms underlying are not conclusive. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs on TA in a porcine model of femoral artery transplantation. MSCs or saline were injected into the soft tissue surrounding the arterial grafts immediately post anastomosis. Four weeks after transplantation, neointimal formation increased significantly in untreated allografts compared with the MSC-treated grafts as assessed by intravascular ultrasound (maximum luminal area stenosis: 40 ± 12% versus 18 ± 6%, p < 0.001). Grafts harvested at 4 weeks showed dense perivascular lymphocyte infiltration accompanied by significant intimal hyperplasia in the untreated but not in the MSC-treated allografts. Serial angiographic examination showed that all of the untreated allografts became occluded at the 8th week whereas the majority of the MSC-treated grafts remained patent at the 12th week post transplantation (n = 12 each group, p < 0.001). Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that Foxp3 expression was comparable between the untreated and the MSC-treated groups. However, expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10), interferon- γ (IFN- γ), and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) was increased significantly in the MSC-treated allografts compared with that in the allograft controls (p = 0.015 for IL-10, p < 0.001 for IFN- γ, and p = 0.011 for IDO). In conclusion, local delivery of autologous MSCs alleviates TA by inducing allograft tolerance via enhanced expression of IL-10, IFN-γ and IDO but not Foxp3-positive cells in the vessel wall. These results suggest that MSCs induce immune tolerance by activating the type 1 regulatory T-like cells." ;

      rdfs:comment """Tissue biopsies of the last vaccination site and of the VIN lesion prior to the first vaccination and 3 months after the last vaccination were analysed for the presence of HPV16-specific T cells.

The IFN?-ELISPOT analysis and proliferation with its accompanying cytokine production revealed a strong and broad vaccine-induced T cell response. The strength of the immune response (defined as breath and magnitude of the response) was significantly higher in the patients with a complete remission (CR) than in the patients with no changes (NC) in the lesion size. Phenotypical anlaysis revealed a strong induction of CD4+ T-cells specifically against HPV16 E6 and E7, whereas CD8+ T cells were found merely against HPV16 E6 and to a less broad array of epitopes within each patient. This analysis was done after one in vitro restimulation, however, by directly ex vivo flow cytometric analysis hardly any CD8+ T cell response could be detected. The T cell cultures obtained from the biopsies taken of the last vaccination site were found to be HPV16 peptides specific in 3/5 tested NR patients and in 4/5 tested CR. However, recognition of the recombinant HPV16 E6 and/or E7 protein was observed in 1/5 cultures from NR patients and 4/5 cultures of the CR patients, suggesting the differences in vaccine-induced T-cell reactivity. Tissue biopsies of the VIN lesion before and after vaccination showed only in one patient a HPV16-specific T-cell response, which was against HPV16 E6 and merely of the type 2 cytokine producing T cells. Notably, no T-cell cultures could be obtained from VIN biopsies taken from the CR patients. In conclusion, the HPV16 E6 and E7 synthetic long peptides vaccine is highly immunogenic, in that it increases the number and activity of HPV16-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells to a broad array of epitopes in all patients. The expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-specific T-cells, both considered to be important in the anti-tumor response indicates the immunotherapeutic potential of this vaccine. Addition of a strong toll-like receptor ligand might increase the CD8 response in frequency and to a broader set of epitopes.""" ;

      dc:description "Leishmaniasis is a group of important parasitic diseases affecting millions worldwide. To understand more clearly the quality of T helper type 1 (Th1) response stimulated after Leishmania infection, we applied a multiparametric flow cytometry protocol to evaluate multifunctional T cells induced by crude antigen extracts obtained from promastigotes of Leishmania braziliensis (LbAg) and Leishmania amazonensis (LaAg) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healed cutaneous leishmaniasis patients. Although no significant difference was detected in the percentage of total interferon (IFN)-γ-producing CD4(+) T cells induced by both antigens, multiparametric flow cytometry analysis revealed clear differences in the quality of Th1 responses. LbAg induced an important proportion of multifunctional CD4(+) T cells (28% of the total Th1 response evaluated), whereas LaAg induced predominantly single-positive cells (68%), and 57% of those were IFN-γ single-positives. Multifunctional CD4(+) T cells showed the highest mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for the three Th1 cytokines assessed and MFIs for IFN-γ and interleukin-2 from those cells stimulated with LbAg were significantly higher than those obtained after LaAg stimulation. These major differences observed in the generation of multifunctional CD4(+) T cells suggest that the quality of the Th1 response induced by L. amazonensis antigens can be involved in the mechanisms responsible for the high susceptibility observed in L. amazonensis-infected individuals. Ultimately, our results call attention to the importance of studying a Th1 response regarding its quality, not just its magnitude, and indicate that this kind of evaluation might help understanding of the complex and diverse immunopathogenesis of American tegumentary leishmaniasis." ;

For extracellular analysis of live antigen-specific Th-cells cells are stimulated in the presence of an anti-CD40 blocking antibody and biotinylated anti-CD154 antibody. We have used this system to detect antigen-specific Th-cells after in vitro or ex vivo stimulation.  Since the entire population of antigen-specific Th-cells can be assessed in combination with intracellular cytokine analysis the methodology enables a combined quantitative and qualitative highly sensitive monitoring of Th-cell immunity (also after DC vaccination).

Results obtained from the LC-MS/MS analysis of the integral plasma membrane proteome of D1 cells stimulated for 24 hours with LPS have been compared to the results obtained from immature D1 cells. As expected, DC up-regulated the cell surface expression of all proteins known to be part of the so-called “immunological synapse”, namely MHC class II (region E and K), CD40, CD80, CD86 and ICAM. Interestingly, LPS stimulation caused down-regulation of the AXL receptor, which has been reported to be associated in vivo with the control of the responsiveness of antigen-presenting cells to LPS. Although these data still need independent validation, we would like to propose that DC need to down-regulate this inhibitory receptor upon encountering a maturation stimulus in order to be released from their immature state and to be licensed to achieve a fully mature phenotype." ;

NK cells of both young and aged mice exhibited significantly increased: interferon-γ production after interleukin (IL)-12 or IL-15 alone or any combination of IL-12, IL-18, and IL-2; cytotoxicity after IL-2 or IL-15; and granzyme B expression after IL-15. The only significant age-associated differences were observed in interferon-γ production after IL-15 or IL-12 + 18 + 2 and in granzyme B expression following IL-2 or IL-15. Perforin expression did not increase following stimulation; however, NK cells from aged mice expressed significantly higher levels than young mice. These results underscore the complexity of the cytokine-induced functional activities of NK cells and illustrate the differential response of NK cells from young and aged mice to cytokine stimulation." ;

Meanwhile, they have finalized their effort and have been repeating 3 times this analysis to put quantitative figures on the qualitative list of identified proteins. This list has been transferred to Duccio Cavalieri as part of the DC-ATLAS effort.

These different cell types have a different distribution in the blood as compared to other lymphoïd organs. We characterized these subtypes in the blood by single-cell multiparametric analysis.

      dc:description "The mechanism underlying persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains unclear. We investigated the role of innate immune responses to persistent HBV infection in 154 HBV-infected patients and 95 healthy controls. The expression of NKG2D- and 2B4-activating receptors on NK cells was significantly decreased, and moreover, the expression of DAP10 and SAP, the intracellular adaptor proteins of NKG2D and 2B4 (respectively), were lower, which then impaired NK cell-mediated cytotoxic capacity and interferon-γ production. Higher concentrations of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) were found in sera from persistently infected HBV patients. TGF-β1 down-regulated the expression of NKG2D and 2B4 on NK cells in our in vitro study, leading to an impairment of their effector functions. Anti-TGF-β1 antibodies could restore the expression of NKG2D and 2B4 on NK cells in vitro. Furthermore, TGF-β1 induced cell-cycle arrest in NK cells by up-regulating the expression of p15 and p21 in NK cells from immunotolerant (IT) patients. We conclude that TGF-β1 may reduce the expression of NKG2D/DAP10 and 2B4/SAP, and those IT patients who are deficient in these double-activating signals have impaired NK cell function, which is correlated with persistent HBV infection." ;

      dc:description "Free radicals such as nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in many physiological processes. In humans, there are 5 homologs of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (Noxes) that generate superoxide (O(2)(-)), which can dismute to produce ROS, and play significant roles in innate immunity and cell proliferation. Though Noxes have been identified in vertebrates (humans and fishes) and some insects, there are very few reports investigating Noxes in crustaceans. In the present study, we describe the entire cDNA sequence (4216 bp) of Marsupenaeus japonicus (kuruma shrimp) Nox (MjNox) generated using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and random amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The open reading frame of MjNox encodes a protein of 1280 amino acids with an estimated mass of 146 kDa that has 46.8% sequence homology with the Nox gene of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Highly conserved amino acid sequences were observed in the NADPH binding domain. Transcriptional analysis revealed that MjNox mRNA is highly expressed in the lymphoid organ, hepatopancreas and hemocytes of the healthy kuruma shrimp. In the hemocytes, MjNox expression reached its peak 4 h after stimulation with either Vibrio penaeicida or poly(I:C) and decreased to its normal level after 12 h.This study is the first to identify and clone a Nox family member (MjNox) from a crustacean species." ;

      dc:description "Bacterial microcompartments are organelles composed of a protein shell that surrounds functionally related proteins. Bioinformatic analysis of sequenced genomes indicates homologs to shell protein genes are widespread among bacteria, and suggests that the shell proteins are capable of encapsulating diverse enzymes. The carboxysome is a bacterial microcompartment that enhances CO2 fixation in cyanobacteria and some chemoautotrophs by sequestering ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) and carbonic anhydrase (CA) in the microcompartment shell. Here we report the in vitro and in vivo characterization of CcmN, a protein of previously unknown function that is absolutely conserved in β-carboxysome gene clusters. We show that CcmN localizes to the carboxysome and is essential for carboxysome biogenesis. CcmN has two functionally distinct regions separated by a poorly conserved linker. The N-terminal portion of the protein is important for interaction with CcmM and, by extension, RuBisCO and the carbonic anhydrase, CcaA, whereas the C-terminal peptide is essential for interaction with the carboxysome shell. Deletion of the peptide abolishes carboxysome formation, indicating its interaction with the shell is an essential step in microcompartment formation. Peptides of similar length and sequence properties to that in CcmN can be bioinformatically detected in a large number of diverse proteins proposed to be encapsulated in functionally distinct microcompartments, suggesting that this peptide and its interaction with its cognate shell proteins is a common feature of microcompartment assembly." ;

      dc:description "We hypothesized that CD4+CD25hiFoxP3+ Treg could be involved in the high immune activation existing in patients with low-level CD4 repopulation under suppressive HAART.Sixteen \"low-level\" patients, 18 HIV-controls and 16 healthy subjects were included. The frequency of CD4+CD25hiFoxP3+ and HIV-specific Treg suppressive function were assessed. Relationships between Treg and CD4/CD8 activation (HLA-DR/CD38) and the frequency of naïve CD4 T-cells were assessed.\"Low-level\" patients showed a higher Treg frequency but reduced HIV-specific immunosuppressive functions than HIV-controls. Whereas in healthy subjects a strong negative correlation between Treg and activated CD8 emerged (r=-0.75, p<0.001), it appeared disrupted in both HIV-infected groups (r=-0.06, p=0.83; r=-0.11, p=0.68 for \"low-level\" and HIV-control patients, respectively). Nevertheless, in \"low-level\" patients, Treg negatively correlated with naïve CD4 T-cells (r=-0.60, p=0.01), whereas did not correlate in HIV-control or healthy subjects (r=-0.19, p=0.46; r=-0.10, p=0.73, respectively). Remarkably a higher Treg/naïve CD4 ratio was observed in the \"low-level\" than in HIV-control (p=0.001) and healthy subjects (p<0.001)We conclude that low-level CD4 repopulation patients have important alterations in immunoregulation involving CD4+CD25hiFoxP3+ Treg. In this scenario, the role of Treg seems to be more related to the control of the naïve CD4 T-cell homeostatic proliferation, rather than to the immune activation." ;

The initiation of cytotoxic immune responses requires the direct interaction between naïve CD8+ T lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Multi-photon imaging showed that during priming, naïve T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) establish sequentially brief (i.e. minutes) and long (hours) antigen-specific contacts. We observed that ICAM-1 expression by mature DCs is critical for long-lasting contacts with CD8+ T cells, but dispensable for short-lived antigen-specific interactions. Serial brief T cell-dendritic cell contacts induced early CD8+ T cell activation, proliferation and effector CTL differentiation in the first few days after immunization. ICAM-1-deficient mature DCs, however, failed to induce fully effective priming, as CD8+ T in the LNs draining the immunization site produced reduced levels of IFN?, were clonally depleted after 2 weeks, and the mice failed to respond to re-challenge. Our results indicate that ICAM-1-dependent long lasting interactions between mature DCs and naïve CD8+ T cells determine the survival of activated CD8+ T cells and the establishment of effective memory." ;

      dc:description "OBJECTIVE:: The acute respiratory distress syndrome may complicate postpartum hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation, but its mechanisms are not yet well defined. We studied the lung inflammatory response to postpartum hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation in a rabbit model and the role of the nuclear factor-κB pathway. DESIGN:: Randomized, controlled, prospective study. SETTING:: University hospital laboratory. SUBJECTS:: Nonobstetric (not pregnant nor postpartum) and obstetrical (within 2 hrs postpartum) rabbits. INTERVENTIONS:: Nonobstetric and obstetric female New Zealand white rabbits underwent fixed-pressure or fixed-volume hemorrhagic shock for 30 mins and then were rapidly resuscitated with the shed blood and Ringer's solution. Finally, they were either monitored for survival time or euthanized by exsanguination for lung tissue examination 24 hrs after hemorrhage. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: After hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation, median survival time in obstetric rabbits (3 days) was significantly shorter (p < .05) than that in nonobstetric rabbits (5 days). Compared with nonobstetric rabbits, obstetric rabbits had more severe lung injury as indicated by alveolar and interstitial fluid accumulation and marked neutrophil sequestration and greater lung injury score, myeloperoxidase activity, expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, serum tumor necrosis factor-a levels, and nuclear factor-κB activation, and lower serum interleukin-10 levels (p < .05 for all). CONCLUSIONS:: After hemorrhage and resuscitation, obstetric rabbits had significantly shorter survival time and more severe lung injury than nonobstetric rabbits. The mechanism may be through upregulation of the signal transductions of the nuclear factor-κB pathways." ;

However, the effects of these nanoparticles on primary human cells are largely unknown. The ability of nanoparticles to exacerbate pre-existing inflammatory disorders is not well documented for engineered nanoparticles, and is certainly lacking for CeO(2) nanoparticles. We investigated the inflammation-modulating effects of CeO(2) nanoparticles at noncytotoxic concentrations in human peripheral blood monocytes." ;

      rdfs:comment """Data was obtained on the infiltration and destruction of solid tumors by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). 

Although the immune system evolved to fight infections, it may also attack and destroy solid tumors. In most cases, tumor rejection is initiated by CD8+ CTLs, which infiltrate solid tumors, recognize tumor antigens and kill tumor cells. We used a combination of two-photon intravital microscopy and immunofluorescence on ordered sequential sections to analyze the infiltration and destruction of solid tumors by CTLs. We show that in the periphery of a thymoma growing subcutaneously, activated CTLs migrate with high instant velocities. When the tumors express cognate antigens the CTLs are arrested in close contact to tumor cells. In regions of the tumors where the tumor cells are dead, CTL motility resumes, using apparently non-guided trajectories, or following collagen fibers or blood vessels. Strikingly, CTLs followed blood vessels for extended lengths, adopting an elongated morphology. CTLs also infiltrated tumors in depth, but only when the tumor cells express the cognate CTL antigen. In tumors that do not express the CTL cognate antigen, we observe peripheral infiltration by CTLs, but the lymphocytes neither stop moving, nor kill tumor cells or infiltrate tumors deeply. Antigen expression by tumor cells therefore determines both CTL motility within the tumor and the depth of tumor infiltration. This work is currently submitted for publication.""" ;

Since LPS-activated DC are potent inducers of NK cell priming and lymph nodes appear to be a key place in which DC and NK cell interactions occur, we have investigated the in vivo capacity of resting and DC-primed NK cells to reach the draining lymph nodes. DC –activated NK cells reach the draining lymph node within 24 hours after intravenous injection and persist there for at least 72 hours. NK cells distribute at the periphery of T cell areas, where also DC are known to be located. By further analysis of the molecular mechanisms responsible for NK cell activation by LPS-primed DC, we have found that three soluble DC-derived molecules, IL-2, type I interferons (IFNs), and IL-18, are necessary and sufficient to elicit efficient production of IFN gamma from NK cells. These analyses have been performed also in vivo by using appropriate mouse models in which conditional ablation of DCs can be achieved and we have confirmed the relevance in vivo of DC-derived IL-18, type I IFNs and IL-2 in NK cell activation.

We plan to study the physiological relevance of NFAT activation in DCs and of CD14-mediated activation of NFAT pathway in vivo. We also plan to describe the TLR4 and CD14 signal transduction pathway in DCs following LPS activation.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """The initiation of a multi partner trial is planned and data will be generated. The DC-THERA trial will compare the use of ‘TRI-MIX’ RNA in clinical trials that were already underway at each of the three centres (Nijmegen Medical School, Nijmegen; Friedrich-Alexander University, Erlangen; Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels).

It was decided that Friedrich-Alexander University, Erlangen, would apply for a licence to prepare GMP-grade ‘TRI-MIX’ RNA and subsequently supply this for all three centres.

The multi-centre trial is a well-standardised, two-arm, multi-centre clinical trial in melanoma patients comparing DC transfected with mRNA coding for constitutively active TLR-4, CD40 and CD70 (‘TRI-MIX’) with other modalities. The trial will be conducted across the 3 centres mentioned above using standardised SOPs – both for preparation of DC and for subsequent immunomonitoring. At these respective centres the following will be compared:

1) peptide-pulsed DC, matured either with the standard maturation cocktail (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha, PGE2) or transfected with ‘TRI-MIX’, and administered intra-nodally under ultrasound guidance (Nijmegen)
2) antigen mRNA-transfected DC, matured either with the standard maturation cocktail (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha, PGE2) or transfected with ‘TRI-MIX’, and administered subcutaneously (Erlangen)
3) antigen mRNA-transfected DC, co-transfected with ‘TRI-MIX’, comparing intradermal vaccination with intradermal plus intravenous vaccination (Brussels).

The analyses of all DC vaccination trials published has shown that this general vaccination strategy is clearly promising given the fact that the adoptive transfer of antigen-loaded DC (i.e. DC vaccination) appears more immunogenic than other vaccination strategies and clinical effects have also been observed even with first generation DC vaccines. The major deficit in this field is that the obvious variables are simply not addressed in a well-coordinated fashion to allow rapid optimization. This is a pity as DC vaccination is rather unique in that it allows to control ex vivo many biological aspects of DC relevant for optimized DC vaccination but also for other more conventional vaccine strategies (which also depend on DC as antigen in various formats + adjuvant is injected which has to reach and activate DC in situ). The reason for the lack of coordinated testing including combination strategies appears to differ in industry and academia. Biotech companies naturally focus on strategies which are covered by their intellectual property and patents, and in academia there are people with different ideas and visions who in addition have to “publish and perish” even if dealing with mid- to long-term efforts such as clinical trials for which in addition there is insufficient funding. 

After treatment of 50% of the patients (i.e. 15 patients in the Tri-Mix-DC arm) or by the end of 2009, whichever comes first, we will perform an interim analysis of this immunogenicity trial. A final immunogenicity analysis, which might identify a particularly immunogenic superior DC vaccine, will be available by mid 2010. The clinical fate of the patients will be followed further but this is not the endpoint of this immunogenicity trial. """ ;

DCs were exposed to cytochalasin D (10 microg/ml, TebuBio) for 30 minutes at 4°C. After washing with cold PBS, DCs were stimulated with S. cerevisiae yeast cells or spores at a DC:stimuli ratio of 4:1 for 24 hours. IL-12p70 production was assessed by ELISA.

IL-12p70 blocking assay
In order to assess the importance of IL-12p70 in balancing Th1/Th17 response two different experiments were performed.
In one case, DCs were stimulated for 8 hours with live spores of S. cerevisiae and C. albicans hyphae at a stimuli:DC ratio of 4:1 in the presence of different concentration of human recombinant IL12p70 (0, 1, 10 and 100 ng/ml).
In the second experiment, DCs were pre-incubated with different concentrations (0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 microg/ml) of a monoclonal anti-human IL-12 antibody for 2 hours, then stimulated for 8 hours with live S. cerevisiae cells in a stimuli:DC ratio of 4:1. 
The ability of these stimulated DCs to drive CD4+ T cells polarization towards a Th1 response was assessed by measuring of IFNgamma and IL-17 in T cells 5-day culture supernatants.""" ;

On the one hand, the human immune system consists of innate and adaptive immune cells that function to defeat pathogens, and on the other hand, pathogens have coevolved to use the system for their own propagation. C-type lectins are conserved receptors recognizing carbohydrate structures on viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi. C-type lectins such as DC-SIGN, langerin, and dectin-1 are expressed by dendritic cell subsets and macrophages. Pathogen recognition by C-type lectins triggers signaling pathways that lead to the expression of specific cytokines which subsequently instruct adaptive T helper immune responses. T helper cell differentiation is crucial for initiating proper adaptive immune responses; some pathogens, however, use pattern recognition receptors like C-type lectins to subvert immune responses for survival. This review provides an update on the role of C-type lectins in HIV-1, mycobacterial, and Candida infections, and the coevolution of hosts and pathogens." ;

To address this issue and obtain data on this question, we have infected susceptible BALB/c (H2-d) mice with a recombinant Leishmania major parasite expressing a fluorescent tracer. We have directly visualized antigen-presenting cells using a mAb reacting to an antigenic peptide derived from the parasite LACK antigen bound to I-Ad MHC class II molecule. I-Ad/LACK complexes were readily detected at the surface of freshly purified parasite-containing DC which expressed a CD8?- CD11b+ F4/80+ gp40- surface phenotype. As demonstrated by electron microscopy some DC contained live amastigotes and expressed I-Ad/LACK complexes in the membrane of the parasitophorous vacuole. Therefore, LACK could be processed and presented to T cells by infected DC in vivo .Furthermore, the presence of I-Ad/LACK complexes on the membrane of parasite-containing phagosomes demonstrated that peptide loading was occuring in this cellular compartment." ;

We tested whether vitamin D supplementation could improve endothelial function and other markers of vascular function in patients with a history of myocardial infarction. METHODS: Parallel group, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomised trial. Patients with a history of myocardial infarction were randomised to receive 100,000 units of oral vitamin D3 or placebo at baseline, 2months and 4months. Outcomes were measured at baseline, 2 and 6months. Reactive hyperaemia index on fingertip plethysmography was the primary outcome. Secondary outcome measures included blood pressure, cholesterol, C-reactive protein, von Willebrand factor, tumour necrosis factor alpha, E-selectin, B-type natriuretic peptide, thrombomodulin and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. RESULTS: 75 patients were randomised, mean age 66years. 74/75 (99%) completed 6month follow-up. 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels increased in the intervention group relative to placebo (+13 vs +1nmol/L, p=0.04). There was no between-group difference in change in reactive hyperaemia index between baseline and 6months (-0.18 vs -0.07, p=0.40). Of the secondary outcomes, only C-reactive protein showed a significant decline in the intervention arm relative to placebo at 6months (-1.3 vs 2.0mg/L, p=0.03). Systolic blood pressure (+1.4 vs +2.3mmHg, p=0.79), diastolic blood pressure (+2.0 vs +0.8mmHg, p=0.54) and total cholesterol (+0.26 vs +0.24mmol/L, p=0.88) showed no between-group difference at 6months.

      dc:description "Sporadic inclusion body myositis is a severely disabling myopathy. The design of effective treatment strategies is hampered by insufficient understanding of the complex disease pathology. Particularly, the nature of interrelationships between inflammatory and degenerative pathomechanisms in sporadic inclusion body myositis has remained elusive. In Alzheimer's dementia, accumulation of β-amyloid has been shown to be associated with upregulation of nitric oxide. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, an overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase was observed in five out of ten patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis, two of eleven with dermatomyositis, three of eight with polymyositis, two of nine with muscular dystrophy and two of ten non-myopathic controls. Immunohistochemistry confirmed protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and demonstrated intracellular nitration of tyrosine, an indicator for intra-fibre production of nitric oxide, in sporadic inclusion body myositis muscle samples, but much less in dermatomyositis or polymyositis, hardly in dystrophic muscle and not in non-myopathic controls. Using fluorescent double-labelling immunohistochemistry, a significant co-localization was observed in sporadic inclusion body myositis muscle between β-amyloid, thioflavine-S and nitrotyrosine. In primary cultures of human myotubes and in myoblasts, exposure to interleukin-1β in combination with interferon-γ induced a robust upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase messenger RNA. Using fluorescent detectors of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, dichlorofluorescein and diaminofluorescein, respectively, flow cytometry revealed that interleukin-1β combined with interferon-γ induced intracellular production of nitric oxide, which was associated with necrotic cell death in muscle cells. Intracellular nitration of tyrosine was noted, which partly co-localized with amyloid precursor protein, but not with desmin. Pharmacological inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase by 1400W reduced intracellular production of nitric oxide and prevented accumulation of β-amyloid, nitration of tyrosine as well as cell death inflicted by interleukin-1β combined with interferon-γ. Collectively, these data suggest that, in skeletal muscle, inducible nitric oxide synthase is a central component of interactions between interleukin-1β and β-amyloid, two of the most relevant molecules in sporadic inclusion body myositis.

Signet ring cell melanocytic nevus is a rare variant of melanocytic nevus characterized by cells with signet ring morphology within a common melanocytic nevus. This article describes an exceptional case of melanocytic nevus composed exclusively of signet ring cells over a trichilemmal cyst. Histologically, above the cyst, there was a small, symmetrical and sharply demarcated lesion showing a compound proliferation of small, round, monomorphous cells with signet ring morphology. Immunohistochemically, signet ring cells were negative for cytokeratin AE1/3, leukocyte common antigen, HMB-45, and CD34. Occasionally, isolated signet ring cells were positive for S-100 and melan A. Melanocytic nevus composed of signet ring cells should raise the differential diagnosis with other cutaneous tumors exhibiting signet ring cells. Previous cases of this entity reported in the literature are also reviewed." ;

Our goal was to generate a probe that could allow the visualization of specific activated DCs following either the immunization of mice with an antigen in adjuvant or an infection with leishmania major parasites. We thus tried to prepare a mAb reacting to the immunodominant LACK156-173 peptide of leishmania bound to I-Ad MHC class II molecules.  To this aim, we injected I-Ad/LACK recombinant dimers to TCR transgenic mice which exhibited an increased frequency of LACK-specific T cells. Four out of 600 supernatants, i.e. 2C44, 2F74, 2E60 and 2X8, readily stained LACK156-173-pulsed fibroblasts, but neither unpulsed fibroblasts nor OVA323-339-pulsed cells. BIAcore measurements yielded equilibrium dissociation constants ranging from 1.1 nM for 2C44 mAb to 120 nM for 2F74 mAb. To investigate whether these mAb could be used to detect APC presenting LACK in vivo, BALB/c mice were immunized or not with either LACK or OVA. LN cells were purified 2 days later, and stained with either 2C44, 2F74, 2E60 or 2X8 mAb. None of these mAb stained DC purified from non immunized mice. However, among the 4 mAb, only 2C44 could stain DC in LACK-immunized mice, but not in OVA-immunized mice. Furthermore, 2C44 stained DC from LACK-immunized mice expressing the H2-d haplotype but did not stain DC from LACK-immunized mice of other haplotypes. Thus, the 2C44 mAb allows for the detection of DC which captured and processed LACK in vivo. We next attempted to characterize the DC which carried I-Ad/LACK complexes at the cell surface in LACK-immunized BALB/c mice. Two different populations of DC, could thus be identified both expressing high levels of CD11c and MHC class II complexes but different levels of CD11b, suggesting that both Langerhans cells and dermal DC were actually presenting the LACK peptide. Following an intradermal immunization with LACK in adjuvant. We finally tried to purify these cells by cell sorting, using 2C44 mAb. In preliminary experiments we succeeded in purifying 300 000 cells from 5 immunized mice. 
Having characterized the antigen-presenting DC in immunized mice, we have now started to visualize and characterize the DC which carry I-Ad/LACK complexes at the cell surface in BALB/c mice infected by leishmania major.""" ;

      dc:description "GnRH binds to its receptor on gonadotropes and activates multiple members of the MAPK signaling family that in turn regulates the expression of several immediate early genes (IEGs) including Jun, Fos, Atf3, and Egr1. These IEGs confer hormonal responsiveness to gonadotrope-specific genes including Gnrhr, Cga, Fshb, and Lhb. In this study we tested the hypothesis that GnRH specifically regulates the accumulation of Jun and Atf3 mRNA through a pathway that includes intracellular Ca(2+), calcineurin, and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Our results indicate that pretreatment of murine LβT2 cells with 1, 2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl)-ester, a Ca(2+) chelator, reduced the expression of all the IEGs to varying degrees, whereas treatment with thapsigargin, an intracellular Ca(2+) protein pump inhibitor, increased the expression of the IEG. Furthermore, cyclosporin A, a calcineurin-specific inhibitor, reduced the ability of GnRH to regulate accumulation of Jun and Atf3 mRNA and to a lesser extent Fos. In contrast, Egr1 mRNA was unaffected. NFATs are transcription factors regulated by calcineurin and were detected in LβT2 cells. GnRH increased luciferase activity of an NFAT-dependent promoter reporter that was dependent on intracellular Ca(2+) and calcineurin activity. Additionally, although small interfering RNA specific for Nfat4 only marginally reduced GnRH regulation of Jun, Fos, and Atf3 mRNA accumulation, activity of an activator protein-1-responsive reporter construct was reduced by 48%. Together these data suggest that calcineurin and NFAT are new members of the gonadotrope transcriptional network that confer hormonal responsiveness to several key genes required for gonadotropin synthesis and secretion." ;

      dc:description "Chitosan, a natural polymer, is a promising system for the therapeutic delivery of both plasmid DNA and synthetic small interfering RNA. Reports attempting to identify the optimal parameters of chitosan for synthetic small interfering RNA delivery were inconclusive with high molecular weight at high amine-to-phosphate (N:P) ratios apparently required for efficient transfection. Here we show, for the first time, that low molecular weight chitosan (LMW-CS) formulations at low N:P ratios are suitable for the in vitro delivery of small interfering RNA. LMW-CS nanoparticles at low N:P ratios were positively charged (ζ-potential ~20 mV) with an average size below 100 nm as demonstrated by dynamic light scattering and environmental scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Nanoparticles were spherical, a shape promoting decreased cytotoxicity and enhanced cellular uptake. Nanoparticle stability was effective for at least 20 hours at N:P ratios above two in a slightly acidic pH of 6.5. At a higher basic pH of 8, these nanoparticles were unravelled due to chitosan neutralization, exposing their polynucleotide cargo. Cellular uptake ranged from 50% to 95% in six different cell lines as measured by cytometry. Increasing chitosan molecular weight improved nanoparticle stability as well as the ability of nanoparticles to protect the oligonucleotide cargo from nucleases at supraphysiological concentrations. The highest knockdown efficiency was obtained with the specific formulation 92-10-5 that combines sufficient nuclease protection with effective intracellular release. This system attained >70% knockdown of the messenger RNA, similar to commercially available lipoplexes, without apparent cytotoxicity. Contrary to previous reports, our data demonstrate that LMW-CS at low N:P ratios are efficient and nontoxic polynucleotide delivery systems capable of transfecting a plethora of cell lines." ;

We have been working in the attempt to overcome the limits in sample availability, exploiting the recent significant improvements of proteomic technology. The results allowed to lower the required sample amount significantly, an essential feature to analyze limited cell populations like dendritic cells. The group completed the measurements of murine dendritic cell subsets and established an in-depth proteomic map of them. These preliminary results show more than 4500 identified proteins in each subset. All of the known markers like CD11c, CD11b, DEC-205, Langerin, etc. were found according to their differential expression pattern.  Due to recent major developments in analysis software it is now possible to compare these subsets quantitatively based on the extracted ion current (XIC) and without any need of stable isotope labels. This software is still in development, but preliminary results show a high similarity of all there subsets in the steady state. 

Experiments have been performed to verify these differences in a biological point of view and analysis of the proteomic data itself using novel label-free software has also been completed. In 2008 our group showed the most comprehensive overview of molecular components in yeast (deGodoy et al.). However this study so far required SILAC (stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture) labelling leaving rare cell populations, like in vivo DC subsets, out of reach. In this work package we introduced a robust and generally applicable quantification technology, which allowed us to quantify the dendritic cell subset proteomes to a depth of more than 5000 proteins. Additionally, we were able to make functional predictions about closely related cell types using our large-scale proteomic data set. Biological follow up experiments fully confirmed our proteomic findings. Currently we are wrapping up our data for publication of the DC subset proteome and the quantitation software.  All our data can be accessed and analyzed through the MAPU database (Gnad et al.)

After finishing our proteomic study of steady-state dendritic cell we will now start to analyze proteomic changes of DC subsets after different stimuli. """ ;

      dc:description "Live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes (LM) is a promising bacterial vector able to induce a T-cell response to tumor-associated antigens and demonstrates great potential for use in vaccine development. A novel recombinant LM-based vaccine (Lmdd (LM ΔdalΔdat)-MPFG (multiple peptide fusing genes)) was developed with the ability to express and secrete hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-related tumor-associated antigens fragments due to the insertion of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-X protein (HBx)-derived epitopes HBx(52-60) and HBx(140-148), the universal T-helper epitope, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) epitope AFP(158-166), and melanoma antigen gene (MAGE)-3(271-279) into the HBV core protein. Following immunization with the Lmdd-MPFG vaccine, macrophages exhibited uptake of the bacteria; the vaccine was then nearly cleared 3 days after the first administration. It disappeared even more quickly following subsequent vaccinations. However, recombinant Lmdd-MPFG allowed for the full development of an antitumor response towards the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A0201 epitopes of MPFG. Each epitope stimulated an augmented T-cell proliferation and enhanced the supernatant level of interferon (IFN)-γ in vitro. In addition, IFN-γ-producing CD8(+) T cells as well as in vivo cytolytic activity were significantly increased in HLA-A2 transgenic mice. Additionally, the Lmdd-MPFG developed a strong antitumor response, as indicated by the significant resistance of immunized mice to MPFG-positive Hepa1-6 cell challenge in both a prophylactic and therapeutic setting. Tumor regression was accompanied by an enhanced cytotoxic T lymphocyte response and a decrease of regulatory T cells in the tumor. Collectively, these results suggest that utilizing attenuated LM as a vaccine vector, able to carry the MPFG gene, presents a potentially feasible strategy for prevention of HCC.Oncogene advance online publication, 19 September 2011; doi:10.1038/onc.2011.395." ;

Due to strong background from the autologous DC we decided that HEK293 transfected with one HLA-allele at a time plus simultaneously transfected with up to 5 tumor antiges would be optimal to screen for antigen specificity in the patients T cells. However, during a second T cell culture to expand large numbers of T cells for this screening procedure a drastic expansion of regulatory T cells was observed. Since no sufficient number of T cells could be expanded the screening was not performed. The reason for the altered phenotype/function of the expanded T cells from the second bleeding of this patient is currently not known." ;

      dc:description "B cells are important in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and some of the effects are not dependent on maturation of B cells into immunoglobulin (Ig) producing plasmablasts and plasma cells. B cells present antigen, activate T cells, and are involved in immunoregulation and cytokine secretion. To determine if B cells from MS patients secrete products that have deleterious effects on glial cells not mediated by Ig, and to compare effects with secretory products of normal controls (NC), we isolated B cells from 7 patients with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and 4 NC. B cells were cultured alone or after stimulation with CD40 ligand (CD40L), CD40L+cross-linking of the B cell antigen receptor (xBCR) and CD40L+xBCR+stimulation of toll like receptor 9 (TLR9). Supernatants were harvested and incubated with mixed central nervous system (CNS) neonatal rat glial cells. Supernatants from unstimulated NC B cells induced on average death of 7% (range 0-24%) of differentiated oligodendrocytes (OL); in contrast, supernatants from unstimulated B cells from RRMS patients induced death of 57% (range 35-74%) of OL. Supernatants of stimulated B cells from NC did not increase the minimal OL death whereas stimulation of B cells from RRMS had variable results compared to unstimulated B cells. Supernatants from both NC and RRMS induced microglial enlargement and loss of normal resting bipolar morphology. OL death did not correlate with levels of tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-α), lymphotoxin alpha (LT-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) or any combination or ratio of these cytokines. Analysis of 26 supernatants from NC and RRMS patients failed to detect IgM. There were very low levels of IgG in 8 of the 26 supernatants, and no correlation between of OL death and presence or absence of IgG. Sera used in both the B cell and glial cell cultures were heated, which inactivates complement. The effects of B cell supernatants on OL could be direct and/or indirect involving either microglia and/or astrocytes. The identity of the toxic factor(s) is as yet unknown. Thus we have demonstrated that B cells from patients with RRMS but not NC secrete one or more factors toxic to OL. It is possible that such factors produced by peripheral blood B cells when within the CNS could contribute to demyelination in MS patients." ;

The IFN?-ELISPOT analysis and proliferation with its accompanying cytokine production revealed a strong and broad vaccine-induced T cell response. The strength of the immune response (defined as breath and magnitude of the response) was significantly higher in the patients with a complete remission (CR) than in the patients with no changes (NC) in the lesion size. Phenotypical anlaysis revealed a strong induction of CD4+ T-cells specifically against HPV16 E6 and E7, whereas CD8+ T cells were found merely against HPV16 E6 and to a less broad array of epitopes within each patient. This analysis was done after one in vitro restimulation, however, by directly ex vivo flow cytometric analysis hardly any CD8+ T cell response could be detected. The T cell cultures obtained from the biopsies taken of the last vaccination site were found to be HPV16 peptides specific in 3/5 tested NR patients and in 4/5 tested CR. However, recognition of the recombinant HPV16 E6 and/or E7 protein was observed in 1/5 cultures from NR patients and 4/5 cultures of the CR patients, suggesting the differences in vaccine-induced T-cell reactivity. Tissue biopsies of the VIN lesion before and after vaccination showed only in one patient a HPV16-specific T-cell response, which was against HPV16 E6 and merely of the type 2 cytokine producing T cells. Notably, no T-cell cultures could be obtained from VIN biopsies taken from the CR patients. In conclusion, the HPV16 E6 and E7 synthetic long peptides vaccine is highly immunogenic, in that it increases the number and activity of HPV16-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells to a broad array of epitopes in all patients. The expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-specific T-cells, both considered to be important in the anti-tumor response indicates the immunotherapeutic potential of this vaccine. Addition of a strong toll-like receptor ligand might increase the CD8 response in frequency and to a broader set of epitopes.""" ;

Herein, we utilized a unique human myeloid leukemic cell line, AML-193, which responds to all three cytokines to analyze the regulation at microRNA level. Using real-time PCR-based miRNA expression profiling, we investigated miRNA signatures regulated by IL-3, GM-CSF and G-CSF for n=704 miRNAs. We discovered that in addition to regulating specific miRNAs, these cytokines also regulate common set of miRNAs, which includes miR-590-5p, miR-219-5p, miR-15b and miR-628-5p. Taken together, we have identified novel candidate miRNAs that may be instructive during leukemic and normal hematopoiesis." ;

Depletion of natural regulatory T cells in tumor bearing mice resulted in rejection of P815 cells, but not EG7-OVA, suggesting that regulatory T cells have a stronger impact on immune responses against weakly immunogenic or auto-antigen (P1A). Treg are detected in growing P815 tumor and there is some evidence that 2 regulatory T cells develop sequentially. T cell activation was monitored by tetramer staining and in vivo CTL assay, and revealed strongly increased frequency of P1A-specific T cells after treatment with chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide, but not after T reg depletion. The histological analysis of progressive versus regressing tumors underscores the role of dendritic cells and Gr1+ cells (yet to be defined population) in tumor rejection. " ;

This study was designed to examine the endogenous CD8+ T cell response in a biphasic ovalbumin (OVA)-induced model of allergic airway disease (AAD) and its subsequent resolution with the development of local inhalational tolerance (LIT). We observed increases in OVA-specific CD8+ T cell numbers in the local lung compartments (bronchoalveolar lavage, lung tissue, hilar lymph node) at AAD and LIT; systemic compartments (spleen, inguinal lymph node) displayed no such increases in CD8+ T cell numbers. OVA-specific CD8+ T cells appeared to exhibit plasticity both phenotypically and functionally. They possessed pro-inflammatory characteristics at AAD, with high phenotypic expression of CD11a and increased functional expression of granzyme B and interferon-γ. In contrast, at LIT they showed increased phenotypic expression of the inhibitory marker NKG2A and functionally did not produce granzyme B or IFN-γ. In addition, in a discontinuous model the OVA-specific CD8+ T cells could be recalled on re-exposure to OVA, demonstrating memory. Finally, confocal microscopy results showed that OVA-specific CD8+ T cells at AAD are associated with B cell aggregates in lung tissue. These B cell aggregates resembled tertiary ectopic lymphoid tissue and may thus provide a local environment for the salient cellular interactions that contribute to the development of LIT." ;

Due to strong background from the autologous DC we decided that HEK293 transfected with one HLA-allele at a time plus simultaneously transfected with up to 5 tumor antiges would be optimal to screen for antigen specificity in the patients T cells. However, during a second T cell culture to expand large numbers of T cells for this screening procedure a drastic expansion of regulatory T cells was observed. Since no sufficient number of T cells could be expanded the screening was not performed.

Our graduates are active throughout the globe, our professors at home on an international platform. The secret of our success comprises numerous components: competence in one's field of special interest; communicativity with associate departments; cross-curricular, transdisciplinary team spirit, alliances with professional practice. Unafraid of taking risks, we are breaking new scientific ground. Ingenuity and normality, ivory tower and workbench, lecture room and laboratory, traditional beer brewing and 'virtual reality' – the Technische Universität München nurtures all these features under its collective roof.

True to our origins, ever since the Technische Universität München was founded as a 'polytechnic school' at the heart of Europe in 1868, we have played an active role in transforming Bavaria from an agricultural state to a high-tech location. Rooted in this tradition we created a powerful international network. We are now an international university. One in every four undergraduates within a total student body of approximately 20,000 comes from abroad. The four-leaf clover symbolises our scientific spectrum: natural sciences, engineering sciences, medicine, life sciences.
 

In our capacity as an up-to-date entrepreneurial university, we pin our hopes on the vast range of human skills, identifying and sponsoring talent. We create teams by pooling new strengths. This leads to top performance and supports Corporate Identity.

Creative licence in the multifaceted world of science ranks high at the TU München. This particularly applies in the case of the TUM Institute for Advanced Study currently under development. It is based on the conviction that an atmosphere of creativity and inspiration, freedom and unbureaucratic support is the most productive source of progress for outstanding scientists.

One of our visions is the goal of becoming the most attractive technical university for women in Germany. With the help of unconventional measures, we want to create a seat of learning and a workplace that complies with the special needs of women and young families.""" ;

      rdfs:comment """The importance of alveolar macrophages and more recently DC in the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) has been well documented, but the relative contribution of plasmacytoid DC during bacterial infections is largely unknown. Thus, data was obtained on the contribution of pDC in acute MTb infection.

We examined whether plasmacytoid pDC are infected and/or activated by MTb, and whether they play a role in regulating bacterial clearance during acute MTb infection and if so how. We have compared these DC with myeloid DC and macrophages with respect to MTb infection. Flow cytometry analysis of CD11c populations in the lung and spleen during acute aerosol MTb infection showed no significant increase in plasmacytoid pDC; however during intravenous MTb infection the levels of plasmacytoid pDC appear to increase 43 days after infection. Lung CD4+ T cells increase after day 8 post aerosol infection as previously published by others. In addition, depletion of plasmacytoid pDC in vivo during acute intravenous MTb infection suggested that this DC subset plays a minimal role in regulating bacterial clearance during the primary immune response. In vitro MTb infection of BM myeloid DC and BM macrophages induced the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12p40 and TNF, as previously reported by others. In contrast, in vitro MTb infection of plasmacytoid pDC did not induce any detectable levels of cytokine. However, CpG stimulation of plasmacytoid pDC induced the cytokines IL-12p40, IL-12p70, TNF and IFN-alpha. Our data suggests that at this stage of infection plasmacytoid pDC may play only a limited role in protection against MTb infection. Our data however, does not address the possibility that plasmacytoid pDC may play a role during chronic infection when death of bacteria may be greater i.e. during memory responses or following antibiotic treatment, which may give release of un-methylated CpG DNA that could potentially activate plasmacytoid pDC via TLR-9, or in response to the virulent strain of MTB HN878 as described by Manca et al., 2001. Since in the mouse CpG stimulates IL-12 and TNF production by macrophages, myeloid and plasmacytoid DC, we also investigated a possible protective role for CpG in protection against MTB infection. We found that administration to mice with CpG could play a role in protection although this was very dependent on the time of administration, the dose of MTb used and the strain of mouse.

The in vitro studies on infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb)  of macrophages and DC have been discontinued. """ ;

General information

    The Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics Graduate Program leads to M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Molecular Biology and Genetics. The department is equipped with modern facilities for gene analysis, cell biology, protein chemistry, recombinant DNA technology and animal experiments. The education is research oriented. Research laboratories of the department are used for graduate student training a The main research activities of the department are on molecular genetics, molecular biology, molecular cell biology, molecular virology, structure-function relationship of proteins and new biotechnologies. The research laboratories of the department are equipped with facilities and equipment needed for gene analysis, protein chemistry, recombinant DNA technology, cell biology, experimental animal research, monoclonal antibody production and biotechnology. Current research programs are in the fields molecular genetics, molecular biology, cell biology, protein structure-function relationships, molecular virology and new biotechnologies. Genes involved in genetic predisposition to cancer and tumor suppression (p53, SMAD2, SMAD4, BRCA1, BRCA2, MLH1, MSH2) are studied in the Turkish population. The Molecular virology program concentrates on the viral etiology of chronic liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma (Hepatitis B and C viruses). Biological functions of proteins involved in tumor suppression (p33, p53, p73, p16, p130, BRCA1), apoptosis (bcl-2, bax, bcl-x), cell cycle (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, retinoblastoma family of proteins), DNA-damage response (p53, BRCA1, DNA-PK), cell-extracellular matrix interactions (syndecans) are studied. Regulation of gene transcription and cell signaling molecules are also studied. DNA- and antibody-based diagnostic tests for cancer and hepatitis viruses are developed. The department has established collaborative projects with national and international research institutions in Europe and The United States. TUBITAK-sponsored program allows selected Ph.D. students to perform long-term research training in foreign research institutions through collaborative research projects.""" ;

Thirty-four patients with planned orthognathic surgery did not present abnormalities of the TMJ on magnetic resonance images and radiographs and did not show the symptoms identified by the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (RDC-TMD); as a result, they were assigned to the control group. Twenty-two patients who sought treatment for TMD during the same period were assigned to the TMD group. Synovial fluid was collected from superior TMJ spaces, and cytokine expression was analysed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Significant differences were tested using Fisher's exact test (p<0.05). Granulocyte Macrophage Colony stimulating Factor (GM-CSF), interferon (INF), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α were detected in the TMD group, whereas no cytokines were detected in the control group. The most prevalent cytokines in the TMD group were IL-1β, IL-6 and GM-CSF. IL-4 and IL-5 were not detected in either the TMD group or in the control group. None of the cytokines that were detected in patients with TMD were found in the articular spaces of normal individuals." ;

In 8 patients bilateral AMD was found along with CM. Revealed changes are considered to be tumor-associated sign of progressing CM. Association of AMD and CM should be considered as a combination of two distinct conditions, when CM disturbs hematoretinal barrier and thus leads to AMD progression." ;

      dc:description "Mechanisms of cyclophosphamide (CY)-induced tolerance were studied. When C3H/He Slc (C3H; H-2k, Mls-1b) mice were primed i.v. with 1 x 10(8) viable spleen cells from H-2-identical AKR/J Sea (AKR; H-2k, Mls-1a) mice and treated with 200 mg/kg of CY 2 days later, a long-lasting skin allograft tolerance to AKR was established. When [C57BL/6 Sea (B6; H-2b, Mls-1b) x AKR]F1 (B6AKF1) cells were used as the tolerogen, however, only a moderate, but not long-lasting, skin tolerance to AKR was observed. In the C3H mice treated with AKR cells and CY, the intrathymic clonal deletion of V beta 6+ T cells, which are strongly correlated with reactivity to Mls-1a antigens, was observed in the chimeric thymus on day 35, although neither the clonal deletion of V beta 6-bearing T cells nor the mixed chimerism was observed in the thymus on day 14. In the C3H mice treated with B6AFKF1 cells followed by CY, however, neither the clonal deletion of V beta 6+ T cells nor the mixed chimerism was observed in the thymus throughout the test period. In the lymph nodes of the C3H mice treated with AKR cells and CY, only CD4+ V beta 6+ T cells, bur not CD8+V beta 6+ T cells, had selectively decreased by day 14, and they were hardly detectable on day 35. The selective decrease of CD4+V beta 6+ T cells in the lymph nodes was also observed by day 14 when B6AKF1 cells were used as the tolerogen, although CD4+V beta 6+ T cells gradually increased on day 35, at which time almost all skin grafts from AKR had already been rejected. These results strongly support the necessity of the intrathymic mixed chimerism and clonal deletion of donor-reactive T cells for a long-lasting skin allograft tolerance in CY-induced tolerance." ;

      rdfs:comment """The latest Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) confirmed The University of Nottingham's position as a world class research-led institution.  Over 60% of the University's RAE scores identified research as being of a level of international excellence.  This achievement has helped put Nottingham within the Sunday Times top ten UK universities.

The purpose of the RAE is to enable higher education funding bodies to distribute public funds for research based on the quality of research carried out at each institution.  The RAE gives quality ratings for research across all disciplines.  A scale ranges from 1 to 5* according to how much of the work is judged to reach national or international standards.

 At the end of 2005-6, the University announced a record £122 million of new research grants and contracts.  Awards for the current year are in line with this figure.  The University derives about 20% of its research income from industry sponsors, reflecting its strengths in taking promising new findings from bench to business.

The University's research strategy is based on the recruitment, promotion and retention of individuals with exceptional research credentials and a policy of encouraging research that crosses academic boundaries.  Collaboration with other international centres of research excellence is actively encouraged.

Significant investment in new research infrastructure at Nottingham is planned for the period 2007-9, which will further improve the quality of equipment and buildings to further the University's research aims.

The University pursues a co-ordinated approach to research management, with two Pro-Vice Chancellors for Research responsible for the University's research strategy through the Research Committee and its Research Strategy Groups.  Delivery of the strategy is the remit of the Research Innovation Services team, which is also responsible for maintaining the University's relationships with external funding organisations.

We examined the antitumor effects of 7-difluoromethoxyl-5,4'-di-n-octylgenistein (DFOG), a novel synthetic genistein derivative, on human ovarian cancer cells as well as the molecular mechanism. The growth-inhibitory effects of genistein and DFOG were determined using MTT assay and clonogenic assay in CoC1 and SKOV3 human ovarian cancer cells. Apoptotic activities of DFOG were observed using histone/DNA ELISA assay and flow cytometry with propidium iodide (PI) staining. Multiple molecular techniques, such as RT-PCR, western blot analysis, siRNA and cDNA transfection were used to explore the molecular mechanism. We demonstrated that nine of the genistein derivatives had a more effective antitumor activity than genistein. Among the afore-mentioned derivatives, DFOG presented with the strongest activity against CoC1 and SKOV3 cells in vitro. DFOG and genistein inhibited the growth of CoC1 and SKOV3 cells, accompanied by cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. DFOG caused apoptotic cell death with concomitant attenuation of Forkhead box protein M1 (FoxM1) and its downstream genes, such as survivin, cdc25B, cyclin B, and increased p27KIP1. Downregulation of FoxM1 by siRNA followed by DFOG treatment resulted in enhanced cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. Upregulation of FoxM1 by cDNA transfection attenuated DFOG-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptotic cell death. Our results show that the molecular role of FoxM1 in mediating the biological effects of DFOG and genistein in human ovarian cancer cells suggests that FoxM1 could be a novel target for the treatment of human ovarian cancer." ;

      dc:description "We investigated the effects of replication-defective herpes simplex virus (HSV) vector expression of interleukin-4 (IL-4) on bladder overactivity and nociception. HSV vector expressing murine interleukin-4 (S4IL4) or the control vector expressing β-galactosidase (SHZ) were injected to the rat bladder wall. At 1 week after viral injection, in cystometry performed under urethane anesthesia, the S4IL4-treated group did not show the intercontraction intervals reduction during intravesical administration of 10 nM resiniferatoxin (RTx). At 2 weeks after viral injection, behavioral studies were performed on vector-injected animals in an awakened state. Freezing behavior induced by 3 μM RTx, administered for 1 min into the bladder, was significantly suppressed in the S4IL4 group compared with the SHZ group. Murine IL-4 levels examined by ELISA were significantly increased in bladder and bladder afferent dorsal root ganglia at 2 weeks after viral injection. The expression of IL-1β and IL-2 and bladder inflammatory responses were significantly suppressed in the RTx-irritated bladder of S4IL4-injected rats. These results indicate that HSV vector-mediated interleukin-4 expression in the bladder and bladder afferent pathways reduces the inflammatory response, bladder overactivity and nociceptive behavior induced by bladder irritation in the rat model. Therefore, IL-4 gene therapy could be a new strategy for treating urinary frequency and/or bladder pain.Gene Therapy advance online publication, 8 March 2012; doi:10.1038/gt.2012.24." ;

In correlation, we found a marked increase in cytolytic and IFN-gamma/tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) secreting CD8(+) T cells.

People come to LMU Munich seeking its unique academic diversity. Its 18 faculties give around 700 professors and 3,000 academic staff room to research and teach. They offer a wide and well-rounded range of learning opportunities that cover all areas, whether humanities and culture studies, law, economics and sociology, or medicine and the sciences.

Our research statistics speak for themselves: LMU Munich is part of 26 Collaborative Research Centers funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and is host university of 14 of them. It also hosts 9 DFG Research Training Groups and four international doctorate programs as part of the Elite Network of Bavaria. It attracts an additional 120 million euros per year in outside funding and is intensively involved in national and international funding initiatives. All this demonstrates why LMU Munich regularly gets top marks in national and international rankings.

With degree programs available in 150 subjects in numerous combinations, the array of courses we have to offer is extremely wide. Some 47,000 students, 16 percent of whom come to us from abroad, are currently taking advantage of these opportunities. They view their studies as an investment in the future, a launching pad for their later careers. We put our faith in imagination, open minds and creative intelligence.

LMU Munich takes the education of young people very seriously. When we speak of academic diversity, we also mean a comprehensive education that encompasses social skills alongside a critical awareness of values and history. This includes the Munich legacy of the Weisse Rose, the student-based resistance group that opposed Nazism.

      dc:description "Myostatin (MSTN), a member of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, is a negative regulator of the skeletal muscle growth, and suppresses the proliferation and differentiation of myoblast cells. Dysfunction of MSTN gene either by natural mutation or genetic manipulation (knockout or knockdown) has been reported to interrupt its proper function and to increase the muscle mass in many mammalian species. RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) has become a powerful tool for gene knockdown studies. In the present study transient silencing of MSTN gene in chicken embryo fibroblast cells was evaluated using five different shRNA expression constructs. We report here up to 68% silencing of myostatin mRNA using these shRNA constructs in transiently transfected fibroblasts (p<0.05). This was, however, associated with induction of interferon responsive genes (OAS1, IFN-β) (3.7-64 folds; p<0.05). Further work on stable expression of antimyostatin shRNA with minimum interferon induction will be of immense value to increase the muscle mass in the transgenic animals." ;

Here we show that BRCA1/p220 silencing in normal human mammary epithelial (HME) cells reduces expression of two RNA-destabilizing proteins, namely AUF1 and pCBP2, both proteins bind and destabilize BRCA1-IRIS mRNA. BRCA1-IRIS overexpression in HME cells triggers expression of several TN/BL markers, e.g., cytokeratins 5 and 17, p-cadherin, EGFR and cyclin E as well as expression and activation of the pro-survival proteins; AKT and survivin. BRCA1-IRIS silencing in the TN/BL cell line, SUM149 or restoration of BRCA1/p220 expression in the mutant cell line, HCC1937 reduced expression of TN/BL markers, AKT and survivin and induced cell death. Collectively, we propose that BRCA1/p220 loss of expression or function triggers BRCA1-IRIS overexpression through a post-transcriptional mechanism, which in turn promotes formation of aggressive and invasive breast tumors by inducing expression of TN/BL and survival proteins." ;

      dc:description "The mechanisms by which common genetic variation predisposes to type 2 diabetes remain unclear. The disease-associated variants in TCF7L2 (rs7903146) and WFS1 (rs10010131) have been shown to affect response to exogenous glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), while variants in KCNQ1 (rs151290, rs2237892, and rs2237895) alter endogenous GLP-1 secretion. We set out to validate these observations using a model of GLP-1-induced insulin secretion. We studied healthy individuals using a hyperglycemic clamp and GLP-1 infusion. In addition, we measured active and total GLP-1 in response to an oral challenge in nondiabetic subjects. After genotyping the relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms, generalized linear regression models and repeated-measures ANCOVA models incorporating potential confounders, such as age and BMI, were used to assess the associations, if any, of response with genotype. These variants did not alter GLP-1 concentrations in response to oral intake. No effects on β-cell responsiveness to hyperglycemia and GLP-1 infusion were apparent. Diabetes-associated variation (T allele at rs7903146) in TCF7L2 may impair the ability of hyperglycemia to suppress glucagon (45 ± 2 vs. 47 ± 2 vs. 60 ± 5 ng/L for CC, CT, and TT, respectively, P = 0.02). In nondiabetic subjects, diabetes-associated genetic variation does not alter GLP-1 concentrations after an oral challenge or its effect on insulin secretion." ;

      dc:description "Survivin and Bcl-2 are generally considered to be inhibitors of apoptosis and are frequently overexpressed in several types of human cancers. However, their role in regulating the biological behavior of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) remains controversial. We aimed to determine the expression of survivin and Bcl-2 and explore their correlation with clinicopathological features and prognosis. The expression of survivin and Bcl-2 proteins in 62 specimens of NSCLC tissues and 30 specimens of tumor adjacent tissues was detected using immunohistochemistry. The correlation between protein expression and clinicopathological features and prognosis was analyzed. The percentage of survivin-positive samples obtained from NSCLC tissues was 58.06% (36/62), which was significantly higher compared to that in normal lung tissues (10%, 3/30; P<0.05). Similarly, the percentage of Bcl-2-positive samples obtained from NSCLC tissues was statistically higher compared to that from normal lung tissues (51.61%, 32/62 vs. 6.67%, 2/30; P<0.05). Survivin expression was closely correlated with tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis and TNM stage (P<0.05), while Bcl-2 expression was only associated with TNM stage (P<0.05). The expression of survivin was positively correlated with that of Bcl-2 (P<0.05). A five-year follow-up study revealed that the expression of survivin and Bcl-2 was negatively correlated with post-operative survival duration. Our findings suggest that survivin and Bcl-2 may act synergistically in the occurrence, development, invasion and metastasis of NSCLC, both of which are up-regulated in NSCLC tissues. The co-expression of survivin and Bcl-2, which is closely related to malignancy, may serve as a biomarker for predicting prognosis." ;

Research at the institute focuses on studies of the relationship between the structure and the activity of biological systems with various degrees of complexity, i.e. nucleic acids as carriers of the genetic information and proteins or peptides as structural components of the three-dimensional organization of the cell. Their folding and function is likewise the subject of the research such as cell organelles, membranes, viruses, oncogenes, archaebacteria, higher cells and whole organisms. These serve as models for the investigation of the molecular bases of biological and pathophysiological phenomena: Cell-cell interactions, cell division, cell growth and - differentiation, gene regulation, signal transmission by nerves, photosynthesis, evolution and cancer. 

A special strength of the institute is the various methodical expertise in the areas of protein chemistry, molecular biology and structure analysis. Research in scientific departments and working groups is supported by central service facilities for DNA- and protein sequence analysis, DNA- and peptide-synthesis, NMR and mass spectrometry, a central library, an information retrieval and managing center, a computing center with bioinformatics unit, an animal house and central workshops. New methods in molecular biology and genetic engineering led to the development of a biomedically oriented basic research of molecular medicine. In this field of research medical questions are connected with molecular-biological techniques, which opens promising possibilities in the pathogenesis research and the development of new diagnostic and therapeutical approaches. The institute cooperates in this area with the pharmaceutical industry on national and international level. Several research groups of the institute are working on this medical orientated field of research, others are dealing with pure basic research. 

At the end of 2005 the institute had 880 employees (including people funded by third parties), of whom 492 were senior scientists and 214 were junior scientists .""" ;

      dc:description "One of the core genes in the circadian regulation network is clock (clk). By forming a heterodimer with CYCLE (CYC) that binds on an E-box in the promoter region, it induces the transcription of other elements in the circadian transcriptional feedback loops and different clock output genes. In contrast to other insects, a clk double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) treatment is lethal in adults and fifth instar nymphs of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, in a dose-dependent manner. Clk knock down fifth instar nymphs are able to undergo their imaginal moult but, depending on the amount of dsRNA, it takes them longer than the controls to reach adulthood. As adults, clk knock down animals do not develop their fat body and ovaries like the control animals. Therefore, we tested the expression of different genes involved in energy metabolism and reproduction to see the effect of the clk RNA interference knock down. Surprisingly, the expression of the vitellogenin gene was up-regulated in the clk knock down females who did not appear to invest their energy in egg development. Taken together, our results point out that the clk gene in the desert locust has an additional function in development besides its established role in maintaining the circadian rhythms in the brain." ;

Treatment

In the 400-bed hospital with its 124 statutory physicians, annually over 11,000 new patients are recruited, 130,000 patients attend its clinics and 42,000 patients receive treatment.
Research

Research is conducted by 400 research scientists under the oversight of a scientific council, a therapeutic trials commission and a clinical research committee.
Teaching

Over 5,000 hours of instruction are taught in its School of Oncology in collaboration with the University of Paris.

Each of these three missions is founded on principles that are the guiding force behind IGR's actions daily:
the excellence principle, through which efforts are united to establish quality standards in oncology;
the innovation principle, that is urgently needed for many cancers that are still incurable;
the evaluation principle, without which it is impossible to advance in a rigorous and methodical manner along the path to new therapies.

Situated in the heart of Europe, at the gateway to Paris, the Institute Gustave-Roussy is poised to undergo thorough restructuring and renovation at the beginning of the 21st century, to enhance its efficacy in its primary commitment towards patients, the fight against cancer.""" ;

      dc:description "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Potential functional allele T/C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of Interleukin 10 (IL-10) promoter 819 (rs1800871) has been implicated in gastric cancer risk. We aimed to explore the role of T/C SNP of IL-10 -819 in the susceptibility to gastric cancer through a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Each initially included article was scored for quality appraisal. Desirable data were extracted and registered into databases. 11 studies were ultimately eligible for the meta-analysis of IL-10 -819 T/C SNP. We adopted the most probably appropriate genetic model (recessive model). Potential sources of heterogeneity were sought out via subgroup and sensitivity analyses, and publication biases were estimated. RESULTS: IL-10 -819 TT genotype is associated with the overall reduced gastric cancer risk among Asians and even apparently observed among high quality subgroup Asians. IL-10-819 TT genotype is not statistically associated with the overall reduced gastric cancer susceptibility in persons with H. pylori infection compared with controls without H. pylori infection. IL-10 -819 TT genotype is reversely associated with diffuse-subtype risk but not in intestinal-subtype risk. IL-10 -819 TT genotype is not reversely associated with non-cardia or cardia subtype gastric cancer susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: IL-10 -819 TT genotype seems to be more protective from gastric cancer in Asians. Whether IL-10 -819 TT genotype may be protective from gastric cancer susceptibility in persons infected with H. pylori or in diffuse-subtype cancer needs further exploring in the future well-designed high quality studies among different ethnicity populations. Direct sequencing should be more used in the future." ;

      dc:description "Background: Current treatments for joint diseases are moderately successful, but unfortunately are associated with significant side effects. This study was undertaken to investigate the combination effects of IL-4 and prednisolone on tissue characteristics and production of matrix metalloproteinase-1(MMP-1) in IL-lα-treated bovine nasal cartilage (BNC) explants. Methods: BNC explants were cultured in DMEM with IL-lα (10 ng/ml), IL-4 (50 ng/ml) and prednisolone (1 or 1,000 nM) at the same time for 28 days. At days 3, 7, 14, 21and 28, the media were collected and replaced with fresh media, and the removed media were stored at -20 C. The alterations of tissue characteristics were assessed by using histology techniques. Western-blot method was used to determine the effects of IL-4 and prednisolone combination on MMP-1 production. The cell viability was evaluated by using lactate dehydrogenase assay test. Results: In the presence of IL-lα alone, most chondrocytes were transformed into fibroblast-like morphology with pyknotic nuclei at day 28. In addition, a clear band of MMP-1 and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation were observed. In combination of IL-4 and prednisolone, chondrocytes preserved their ordinary normal features. MMP-1 band formation was completely inhibited and ECM absolutely showed normal characteristics. IL-4 and prednisolone did not show cytotoxicity effects on BNC explant culture. Conclusion: This combination can strongly preserve cartilage from degradation features and the data possibly suggest that the combination of IL-4 and prednisolone could be a candidate for alternative therapy in joint diseases." ;

      dc:description "IL-36 is the common name for the three IL-1 family members IL-36α, IL-36β, and IL-36γ, formerly known as IL-1F6, IL-1F8, and IL-1F9, respectively. IL-36 appears to have pro-inflammatory activities; however, the physiological function of these cytokines remains unknown. Expression of IL-36 by keratinocytes implies its possible involvement in innate immune responses in the skin. We observed that, of the three IL-36 isoforms, human keratinocytes express high levels of IL-36γ. IL-36γ mRNA expression was dramatically induced by the Toll-like receptor ligands polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) and flagellin. Surprisingly, the IL-36γ protein was released by cells treated with poly(I:C), but remained intracellular in cells treated with flagellin only. poly(I:C), but not flagellin, induced cell death and caspase-3/7 activation. Inhibition of caspase-3/7 and caspase-1 blocked extracellular release of IL-36γ from poly(I:C)-treated cells. Furthermore, caspase-1 inhibition prevented poly(I:C)-induced caspase-3/7 activation. Interestingly, transcription of the gene IL36G was dependent on caspase-1, but not caspase-3/7, activation. This demonstrates that the pathways leading to IL36G transcription and caspase-3/7 activation branch after caspase-1. This divergence of the pathways allows the cells to enter a state of de novo protein synthesis before committing to pyroptosis. Overall, our observations suggest that IL-36γ may be an alarmin that signals the cause, e.g., viral infection, of cell death.Journal of Investigative Dermatology advance online publication, 9 February 2012; doi:10.1038/jid.2011.482." ;

      dc:description "BackgroundGenetic variation influences susceptibility or resistance to tuberculosis (TB). Interleukin-6 contributes to protection against TB in mice, however, its role in regulating susceptibility or resistance to TB in humans is unclear.MethodsGenotyping of polymorphisms in IL-6 and IL-6R (CD126) genes were performed in two independent cohorts, namely experimental (495 cases and 358 controls) and validation (1383 cases and 1149 controls) populations. The associations of the variants with tuberculosis were tested using two case-control association studies. In addition, the regulatory effects of SNP rs1800796 (-572C>G) on IL-6 production in plasma and CD14(+) monocyte cultures stimulated with a Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) product were assessed.ResultsThe rs1800796 polymorphism is associated with increased resistance to TB (odds ratio, 0.771; confidential interval 0.684-0.870). The rs1800796GG genotype is strongly associated with reduced risk to TB (odds ratio, 0.621; confidential interval 0.460-0.838). Interestingly, CD14(+) monocytes isolated from individuals with rs1800796GG genotype produced significantly lower IL-6 in response to Mtb 19kDa lipoprotein than those with CC or CG genotype do.ConclusionsWe identified a genetic polymorphism in IL-6 promoter that regulates the cytokine production and host resistance to pulmonary TB in Chinese population." ;

      dc:description "Many studies which focus on the molecules and mechanisms related to the characteristics of the cancer have been performed. In particular, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are known to play a central role in the adhesion of cancer cells to vascular endothelial cells. In this study, the expression of CAMs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines was analyzed and correlated with the characteristics of various HCC cell lines. Eight human HCC cell lines were used in this study. We analyzed the expression of ICAM-1, E-selectin and the integrin subunits of HCC cell lines by western blot analysis and ELISA kit. We estimated the expression of integrin-α5 using western blot analysis and RT-PCR to compare the expression at the gene level with the protein level. In addition, we determined the expression of TGF-β1, as one of the markers for the cellular activity compared to the levels of expression with the expression of integrin-α3 and -α5. ICAM-1 was highly expressed in all of the cell lines except SNU398 and Hep3B, which exhibit a more aggressive nature among the studied HCC cell lines. E-selectin and integrin subunits varied in all HCC cell lines. In particular, integrin-β2 was highly expressed on all HCC cell lines. In conclusion, the levels of expression of the CAMs may not affect cellular activity, morphology or tumorigenicity. However, most HCC cell lines show various expressions of CAMs, suggesting that HCC cell lines expressing the major CAMs remain candidates for molecular targeted therapy, which may need to be patient-tailored for therapy according to the molecular profile." ;

Although the underlying mechanisms are still undefined, T cells and particularly CD4+ lymphocytes seem to play a crucial role in the initiation of collagen-induced arthritis. To investigate whether CD8+ cells may participate in the pathogenesis of the disease, we have generated lines and clones of cytotoxic T cell hybridomas reactive to CII by fusion of lymph node and spleen cells from bovine native CII-primed C3H.Q (H-2q) mice and the AKR-derived thymoma cell line BW 5147. Clones were selected for their ability to lyse syngeneic macrophages pulsed with bovine native CII in an Ag-dependent manner. The two hybrid clones that were characterized, exhibited cell surface phenotypes of cytotoxic cells and reacted with CII purified from various species. However, each of them recognized different determinants on the CII molecule. P3G8 clone was specific for an epitope shared by CII and type XI collagen, whereas P2D9 clone reacted with CII and type IX collagen. Both hybridomas recognized CII-pulsed targets in association with H-2Kq molecules. These data indicate that the two CII-specific cytotoxic clones recognize different epitopes that are shared by other articular collagens and will allow us to test their influence on the development of arthritis in vivo." ;

      dc:description "The efficacy of islet transplantation is limited by poor graft vascularization. We herein demonstrated that microvesicles (MVs) released from endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) enhanced human islet vascularization. After incorporation into islet endothelium and beta-cells, EPC-derived MVs favored insulin secretion, survival and revascularization of islets transplanted in SCID mice. MVs induced in vitro islet endothelial cell proliferation, migration, resistance to apoptosis and organization in vessel-like structures. Moreover, MVs partially overcame the anti-angiogenic effect of rapamycin and inhibited endothelial-leukocyte interaction via L-selectin and CD40. MVs were previously shown to contain defined patterns of mRNAs. Here we demonstrated that MVs carried the pro-angiogenic miR-126 and miR-296 microRNAs (miRNAs). MVs pre-treated with RNase or derived from Dicer knocked-down EPCs showed a reduced angiogenic effect. In addition, MVs overcame the anti-angiogenic effect of the specific antagomiRs of miR-126 and miR-296, suggesting a relevant contribution of miRNAs delivered by MVs to islet endothelium. Microarray analysis of MV-stimulated islet endothelium indicated the up-regulation of mRNAs coding for factors involved in endothelial proliferation, differentiation and angiogenesis. In addition, MVs induced the activation of the PI3K-Akt and eNOS signaling pathways in islet endothelium. These results suggest that MVs activate an angiogenic program in islet endothelium that may sustain revascularization and beta-cell function." ;

The yeast oligonucleotide array was constructed using the S. cerevisiae Genome Oligo Set ™ (Operon Technologies, CA, USA) composed of 6240 optimized oligonucleotides (70mers) each representing one yeast gene. 

Probe preparation and hybridization:

We used the indirect labeling method. Briefly, the reactive amine derivative of dUTP, 5-(3-
aminoallyl)-2?-deoxyuridine 5?-triphosphate (Sigma) was incorporated into cDNA using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo dT (Invitrogen) and random examers (Roche). After synthesis of cDNA (2–3 h at 42 °C), RNA was hydrolyzed by addition of sodium hydroxide and EDTA to a final concentration of 100 mM and 10 mM, respectively and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The hydrolysis reaction was neutralized with 1 M HEPES. After removing free nucleotides by purification and concentration using Microcon-30 microconcentrators, the aminoallyl-labeled samples were coupled to succinimidyl ester of cyanine-3 (Cy3) and cyanine-5 (Cy5) (Amersham) combined with 1 M NaHCO3, pH 9. Coupling took place in the dark at 25 °C for 1 h. Appropriate Cy3 and Cy5 labeled cDNA samples were purified following Qiagen Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit instructions. Poly-dA (12–18 mer), 20× SSC, and HEPES pH 7.0 were added. After the resultant mix was filtered through a Millipore 0.45 ?M filter, 10% SDS was added. The samples were incubated for 2 min at 100 °C and cooled in a microcentrifuge prior to loading and then applied to microarray. Incubation took place at 65 °C for 12–15 h. Hybridized slides were washed in a solution of water, 20× SSC, and 10% SDS, rinsed in water and 20× SSC, and dried via centrifugation for 2 min at 1000 rpm. 

Image acquisition:

The arrays were scanned immediately. Each comparison was performed in duplicate. Fluorescent cDNA bound to the microarray was detected with a GenePix 4000 microarray scanner (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), using the
GenePix 4000 software package to quantify microarray fluorescence. Intensity values were adjusted by subtracting surrounding background from spots. The median of spot intensities was corrected for background. To eliminate signals that are most prone to estimation error, any spot was excluded from analysis if both the Cy3 and Cy5 mean fluorescence signals were within two standard deviations of the mean background signals for that spot. This procedure avoids artificially inflated measurements of expression due to low signals. Additional to eliminating flagged spots, spots were also visually inspected and flawed ones discarded from the analysis. Data were normalized to mean ratio intensity.

High entrapment (>90 %) and high loading (38.11 ± 0.37 %w/w) of hydrophilic Dox in lipid nanocarrier of polyglyceryl-6-distearate was achieved using poly(methyl vinyl ether-co-maleic anhydride) (Gantrez AN 119) and a modified nanoprecipitation method. Dox-LIPOMER revealed nanosize (314 ± 16.80 nm) and negative zeta potential (-25.00 ± 2.41 mV). Dox-LIPOMER exhibits sustained release in vitro and was influenced by ionic strength of dissolution medium. DSC and XRD studies suggested amorphous nature of Dox in LIPOMER. TEM revealed spherical morphology of Dox-LIPOMER. Dox-LIPOMER was stable up to 12 months at 25 °C/60 % RH. A 384 % enhancement in oral bioavailability compared to Dox solution was observed following Dox-LIPOMER administration at 10 mg/kg body weight. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) assay data of heart and kidney tissues of rats treated with Dox-LIPOMER were comparable with untreated rats. Dox-LIPOMER represents a potential safe drug delivery system for oral administration." ;

METHODS:: Proinflammatory cytokines of cells were determined after being treated with silica dust samples. Adverse health effects of workers were calculated on the basis of a cohort study. RESULTS:: Incidence and mortality of silicosis among tungsten miners were higher than those in other workers. The incidence of interleukin-1β levels was highest in tungsten mines, which was consistent with the incidence of silicosis in tungsten miners. The higher levels of TNF-α and interleukin-6 released from macrophages might be helpful in explaining increased mortalities from lung cancer among tin miners. CONCLUSIONS:: Interleukin-1β could be a sensitive biomarker in predicting fibrogenic potential of silica dust and the risk of silicosis among dust-exposed workers." ;

Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain SK1 (MATa/alpha HO gal2 cupS can1R BIO, Kane SM and Roth J. 1974 Bacteriol. 118: 8-14) was cultured in complete medium (YPD, 2% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 2% glucose) for 18 hours, then collected, washed twice with sterile water and resuspended at 108 cells/ml.  S. cerevisiae strains BY4741 (genotype, Mata his3delta1 leu2delta0 met15delta0 ura3delta0) and BY4741 och1 (Mata his3delta1 leu2delta0 met15delta0 ura3delta0 OCH1::kanMX4) were cultured in complete medium till exponentially phase and treated as before.

2 Spore stimuli
In order to test homogeneous yeast populations, pure spore cultures were obtained by using this strain whose sporulation efficiency is 100%. To prepare spores, cells were grown on YPD plates, replicated on SPOIV medium (2% potassium acetate, 0.25% yeast extract, 0,1% glucose) and sporulation was assessed by optical microscopy. Zymolyase (2 mg/ml) was used to digest ascum and liberate spores. We initially performed experiments to evaluate zymoliase sensitivity of asci for this specific strain and we assessed that 15 minutes incubation was the minimum time needed to damage the ascus, without touching the spore cell wall. Zymoliase was inactivated by heat (65°C for 2 minutes) and washed away carefully together with the remainings of the empty ascus, by resuspending twice the spore culture in 500 µl of distilled water centrifuging and discarding the supernatant; the spores were then resuspended to a concentration of 108 cells/ml. In order to exclude damage on the spore cell wall or effects on spore viability 100 µl of a culture of 1000 spores per ml was plated on YPD in triplicate, the spores showed 100% viability. The procedure used allows exposing DCs to the pure spore culture and to analyze the response to the spores alone, eliminating confounding effects of the presence of the ascus. Although from a mycological point of view the term ascospores might seem more appropriate than spores, we will use the term spores to specifically indicate that the effects we are observing are only due to the spores and not to the ascus. 
We observed that after 24 hours of culture in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO-BRL), spores were germinating and the exponentially growing cells were starting to divide. Therefore any analyses performed at later time points would be affected by this altered state, while no interference should be present until 24 hours. 

3 Candida albicans hyphae stimuli
Serotype A C. albicans strain SC5314 was cultured overnight in Saboraud medium at 28°C and then shifted to RPMI medium for 18 hours at 37°C to allow hyphal growth. The culture was treated as for yeast cells. After microscopical inspection of the purity of hyphal culture, this was treated as for yeast cells. It should be noted that in all the experiments performed in this study live microrganisms were used.""" ;
